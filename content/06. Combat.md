# 6. Combat

Combat is a significant part of many adventures. In combat it is important to know exactly what happens when, who can act at a particular time, and what actions are capable in the amount of time provided. This section addresses the wide variety of actions that occur during a combat round.

As described in **Time Scales**, the combat round measures time in a combat or action situation. A combat round is 12 seconds long, and in it, your character can perform actions and react to other actions in an order usually determined by their DEX characteristic; higher DEX characters act before characters with lower DEX. As with skills, actions in combat are determined by rolling D100 to determine the success or failure of attacks, defenses, and other actions.

## Combat Round Phases

A combat round consists of four phases: **Statements**, **Powers**, **Action**, and **Resolution**. These always occur in the same order and are repeated with each new combat round until the combat is over. Each phase is described below.

### Statements

First, the gamemaster and the players whose characters are involved in a combat round announce what they plan to do. This is the **statement of intent**. Actions can be attempted in order of DEX, highest first. You do not need to announce defensive actions—parries or dodges—unless you opt for a completely defensive stance.

Statements of intent must be reasonable and based on what your character knows.

_For example, you cannot declare an attack upon an opponent your character doesn’t know about, no matter what you know as a player._

Statements of intent are handled in order of the **DEX rank** for everyone involved. Those with high DEX ranks make their statements of intent before those with low DEX ranks. Usually the gamemaster will count down, from the highest DEX rank to the lowest, calling on each player to state their intended actions at the appropriate times.

The gamemaster is not required to state how nonplayer characters will act in a round, but it is considered fair to do so if the actions are physical in nature or otherwise might affect the behavior of the player characters during the combat round.

**_For example,_** _if a group of nonplayer characters visibly looks like they going to withdraw peaceably, a player should know this before their character attacks._

Otherwise, if there’s no way for the players to know what the nonplayer characters are going to do, their actions remain unknown until they act.

Anyone can choose to delay their action until later, with the last action occurring on DEX rank 1. If you delay longer than this, your character takes no action in that combat round (other than defensive). The same is true for nonplayer characters.

If there is a need to determine who acts first when DEX ranks are tied, use the relevant skill to determine who acts first. The character with the higher skill rating goes first. If these are still tied, the actions occur simultaneously.

### Alternates to the Statements of Intent (Options)

Following are three alternative methods of handling the order of actions in a combat round. They can be used as desired, even combined to suit your group’s preferences.

#### Removing the Statement of Intent (Option)

The statement of intent can be gotten rid of entirely for faster play. In this case, jump straight to the powers phase and then into the action phase. This streamlined mode of play has the gamemaster count down DEX ranks in the action phase and each player makes statements of action and immediately rolls to determine the outcome.

#### Reverse Order Statement of Intent (Option)

Reversing the statement of intent allows for a more tactical style of gameplay allowing those with higher DEX ranks the ability to respond better to the actions of other characters, whether opponents or allies. The gamemaster begins with DEX rank 1 and counts upwards, letting all parties announce their actions, as normal. This allows the higher DEX characters the ability to act with full knowledge of what is going to happen in the combat round, enabling them to make tactical decisions accordingly. When the statement of intent phase is over, the gamemaster counts the round down normally. This method creates the opportunity to integrate feints and other potential fake-out maneuvers into combat, allowing for a richer and more tactical environment for any player or gamemaster who enjoys that style of game play.

#### Initiative Rolls (Option)

At the beginning of a combat round, all player and nonplayer characters roll a D10 and add it to their DEX, creating a new and variable DEX rank. Actions still occur in order of DEX rank. For powers, use a D10 plus INT and use this value alongside the DEX ranks. This initiative value (DEX+D10) can be maintained throughout the entire combat.

The gamemaster rolls for each nonplayer character and for convenience can roll 1D10 to represent a group of nonplayer characters, if desired, or even break large groups of nonplayer characters into smaller groups with different initiative rolls. A leader or otherwise exceptional nonplayer character may have their own rolls, to distinguish them from the crowd.

As a note, characters will more likely be able to perform second or third actions in a round using this method, which will make combat rounds somewhat longer.

### Powers

Powers operate in many ways, but in combat they are handled the same. If your character is using an instantaneous power, the power activates during this phase, in order of the involved characters’ INT, highest to lowest. This is called the **INT rank**. Powers that are not instantaneous activate at the beginning of the next combat round in that powers phase, unless otherwise stated.

Anyone may delay their power use until a later INT rank. The last INT rank is 1, and as with DEX rank, if an action is delayed past this rank, it does not occur in this combat round. If INT ranks are tied, use the relevant skill (if any) as the tiebreaker, with the higher skill rating going first. If there is no relevant skill, the higher POW goes first. If still tied, the powers occur simultaneously.

Your character can activate one power per combat round. Using a power in the powers phase of a combat round counts as your character’s action for a round. They cannot attack with a weapon during their DEX rank, but can move if desired, and dodge or parry if required. Most powers require exactly one full combat round to prepare and use, with their effects occurring at the beginning of the next combat round during the powers phase. Exceptions to these are presented in the power descriptions.

Power points used for powers are spent on the INT rank they are used.

### Powers in the Action Phase (Option)

Normally, power use is handled during the powers phase before any physical action happens. To streamline things and even the playing field, power usage can instead occur during normal DEX ranks, just as with a normal attack. The powers phase of the combat round remains as the period where non-instantaneous powers cast during the previous combat round go into effect, but in the action phase, INT ranks and DEX ranks occur side-by-side, combining both countdowns. Your character is still limited to one action, based on what they’re doing: a power goes on the INT rank, a physical action on the DEX rank. Ties are resolved using the other characteristic (if INT is tied, the higher DEX goes first) or the higher skill/power level if applicable. If still tied, the powers happen simultaneously.

### Action

A character in combat is either **engaged** or **unengaged**. An engaged character is within swinging distance of their opponents and is ready to attack or defend when possible. Usually, anyone engaged in a combat can act against anyone else in that combat without penalty or requiring any significant movement. An unengaged character is still acting during the combat but performing other actions and outside the range of hand-to-hand combat (or they are in it, but not actively involved).

As with statements of intent, actions occur on your character’s DEX ranks. Actions can be attacks, parries, dodges, or other actions performed by unengaged characters.

Within a particular DEX rank, attacks usually go in order of weapon type. Attackers armed with missile weapons (bows, guns, etc.) are considered to act before those in hand-to-hand (melee) combat. After these go characters armed with long weapons (spears, lances, etc.), then those with medium-length weapons (swords, axes, etc.) and finally those with short weapons (daggers, etc.) or who are unarmed. Parries and attack-related dodges occur in the same DEX rank as the original attack.

If your character can perform more than one action in a round (some weapons allow for multiple attacks, and combat skill levels in excess of 100% also allow multiple attacks), each attack should be separated by 5 DEX ranks. The first action is at the full DEX rank; the second is at DEX rank –5; the third at DEX rank –10; etc. Your character cannot act on DEX rank 0, so any actions that would occur below DEX rank 1 are lost.

Following is a summary of the results of actions within a combat round. Later in this chapter the results for different levels of success (critical and special successes) and different types of attacks will be described in additional detail.

### Combat Actions

In a combat round your character can perform any one of the following actions on their DEX rank:

- Move
- Attack
- Noncombat action
- Engage
- Disengage

At any time during the combat round, your character can:

- Parry or dodge
- Fight defensively
- Speak

#### Move

If your character is unengaged, they can move around 30 meters in a combat turn if they perform no actions other than to defend themselves (parry or dodge). Moving between 6–15 meters means that your character acts at 1/2 their normal DEX rank. Moving between 16–29 meters in a combat round means that your character acts at 1/4 their normal DEX rank. These modified DEX ranks are cumulative with penalties for additional actions, with movement modifiers to DEX rank being applied first.

#### Attack

Your character can make an attack against a target on their DEX rank, in addition to moving up to 5 meters. Unless modified otherwise, this attack is performed at the full skill rating. As noted above, if a particular weapon allows for multiple attacks, each successive attack should be at 5 DEX ranks lower than the previous attack.

#### Noncombat Action

An unengaged character can attempt the use of a skill or power or do some other action not requiring a skill check, such as drawing a weapon or opening a door. Use common sense as to what actions can reasonably be performed in this amount of time and within the degree of movement allowed. These actions, if combined with combat actions or multiple non-combat actions, incur a DEX rank penalty of 5 per action, unless your gamemaster says they should take longer.

#### Engage

An unengaged character can move up to 5 meters and make an attack and/or defensive action without penalty, engaging in combat.

#### Disengage

An engaged character can choose to leave the combat by declaring during the statement phase that they are disengaging. Generally, they do not take any attack actions, but instead are limited only to dodges, parries, and movement actions. If your character is successful in all dodges or parries made during this combat round, they have successfully disengaged from combat and may move their full movement rate away from the battle. If any of these rolls fail, your character is still engaged in combat. Other options are covered in **Disengaging**.

#### Parry

Anyone armed with a parrying weapon or shield (or using their own body) can block the damage from an attack. Roll against the relevant combat skill to parry a blow. You do not need to announce this beforehand, and it is done in reaction to a successful attack roll from another combatant.

A successful parry usually deflects all damage from the incoming attack (unless you are parrying with your own body as a form of Martial Arts), reducing successful attacks to misses or reducing the severity of special or critical attacks accordingly. Shield armor points and hit points (AP/HP) are used only when dealing with damage done directly to the shield itself, as in an attack to try and destroy a shield or parrying weapon; when resisting damage vs shield armor points on the resistance table when parrying a crushing blow, or when 2 or 4 hit points of damage are done to the parrying weapon or shield on the **Attack and Defense Matrix**.

Each successive parry attempt after the first is modified by –30% to the skill rating, cumulative. If the chance to parry an attack falls below 1%, your character cannot attempt to parry. Under most circumstances, your character can only parry missile weapons with a shield, at the shield’s base chance (see **Shields and Missile Fire**). If attempting to parry a thrown weapon with a hand weapon, the chance of parrying must be a special success (1/5 the normal skill rating).

Similarly, if your character is using improvised weapons or weapons not generally used for parrying, the parry chance is half of the weapon’s skill rating, or a flat 20% if the weapon is not normally parried with or is outside their training. This might be modified based on skill ratings in similar skills, at the gamemaster’s discretion.

**_For example,_** *when firing a rifle, your character has a 58% attack chance, but when parrying an attack with the rifle, their chance is *Difficult_, or 29%, because most modern military rifle training encompasses using it as a parrying weapon. Another character, such as a hunter, on the other hand, with the same attack skill of 58%, has a 20% chance to parry with a rifle, the default chance to parry with a missile weapon. Similarly, a soldier might use an entrenching tool (a small collapsible shovel) as a parrying weapon at 1/2 their skill with an axe, a weapon roughly similar in size and shape._

The gamemaster may rule that a particular attack cannot be parried, such as from a vastly larger attacker (double or more the defender’s SIZ, for example) or when the attacker is using an area or sweep attack.

**_For example,_** _a character with SIZ 15 cannot parry an attack from a brontosaurus of SIZ 72. Instead, the attack must be Dodged or otherwise evaded._

#### Dodge

Some weapons and attacks cannot be parried and must instead be dodged. Dodges can be attempted against all melee attacks or thrown weapons. As with parries, dodges do not need to be announced prior to the attack roll but are attempted in reaction to a successful attack roll from another character (see Dodge). Each successive dodge attempt after the first is at a –30% modifier to the skill rating, cumulative. If the chance to dodge an attack falls below 1%, your character cannot attempt to Dodge.

Normally, a character cannot dodge against bullets or high-speed projectile weapons (arrows, lasers, etc.). Instead, it is assumed that they are dodging out of the direction the weapon is being pointed. In this case, your character is only able to attempt a Dodge against the first such missile weapon in a combat round, and only if the attacker and weapon are visible. Such attempts are _Difficult_. Certain genres or power levels may allow more freedom in dodging missile fire (see **Dodging Missile Weapons**).

#### Fight Defensively

Your character forfeits their ability to attack during a combat round to get one extra Dodge attempt in place of that attack or attacks. This Dodge does not incur the subsequent cumulative –30% penalty for further Dodge or parry attempts (see **Fighting Defensively**).

#### Speak

Speech is a free action, and normal conversation or shouted commands do not cost any DEX ranks or limit your character’s actions in any significant manner. However, if your character is speaking for some time, or a conversation between two characters is ensuing amid action, your gamemaster may ask you to keep conversations brief during combat rounds or action sequences. This may vary by setting: while it is perfectly normal for soliloquies to be delivered during a fistfight in a superhero game, they would be out of place in a Wild West gunfight.

#### Parries and Dodges

Parries and dodges cannot be combined in a round unless your character is in a completely defensive state. In this case, the –30% modifiers for successive defensive actions include both parries and Dodges.

## Resolution

To make an attack, parry, or dodge, roll percentile dice and compare the result to your character’s skill with the weapon or shield being used. Attacks may provoke a dodge or parry, rolled in the same fashion. The success or failure of these rolls is compared to the **Attack and Defense Matrix** to see the result of the combined actions of the attacker and defender.

### Melee hHit Location Table (Option)

As described in **Hit Points per Hit Location**, your character’s hit point total is divided among their body parts, as well as being kept track of as a total. When an attack is successful, roll a D20 and use the result to consult the appropriate hit location table. Humans use the standard hit location table, and other body types have their hit location tables provided in **Nonhuman Hit Locations Tables** in _Chapter 11: Creatures_. If your character is not humanoid, your gamemaster should indicate the correct hit location table you should use.

##### Hit Locations

|D20 Roll|Result|Description|
|---|---|---|
|1–4|Right Leg|Right leg from hip to bottom of foot|
|5–8|Left Leg|Left leg from hip to bottom of foot|
|8–11|Abdomen|Hip joint to bottom rib cage|
|12|Chest|Ribcage up to neck and shoulders|
|13–15|Right Arm|Entire right arm|
|16–18|Left Arm|Entire left arm|
|19–20|Head|Neck and Head|

Some situations, such as cover or mounted vs. unmounted characters, modify what hit locations are available to be hit in combat (see the relevant entries in _Chapter 7: Spot Rules_).

### Combat Summary

|Attack Roll|Parry or Dodge Roll|Result|
|---|---|---|
|Success|Success|Attacker’s blow is deflected or dodged.|
|Success|Fails|Defender is hit and may lose hit points.|
|Fails|No roll required|Defender maintains guard, does not need to roll.|
|Fumbles|No roll required|As per attacker’s miss above, plus attacker rolls on fumble table.|

### Levels of Success and Failure

As with skills, in combat it is often essential to know not only whether an attack or parry succeeded or failed, but also how well it succeeded or how badly it failed.

### Critical Success

The best possible roll! A D100 result equal to 1/20 of your character’s skill rating. A critical attack means that the weapon does the maximum possible damage for the weapon used (6 for 1D6, 9 for 1D8+1, etc.) plus the normal rolled damage modifier. Unless countered with a critical parry, a critical attack result always ignores armor, even if that armor is all-encompassing. A critical parry can damage the attacking weapon.

**_For example,_** _if your character has a weapon skill rating of 60%, they achieve a critical success on a roll of 01–03. When this is rolled, your character simply takes the maximum damage the weapon can inflict, rolls the damage modifier as normal, and ignores any armor the target may be wearing, whether natural or powered. If the critical success is with a shortsword that does 1D6+1 damage, and your character’s damage modifier is 1D4, the critical damage is 7+1D4 (6+1=7), ignoring the target’s armor. If the weapon is a pistol that does 1D10 damage, the damage is 10 and ignores the target’s armor._

Your gamemasters can allow your character to inflict a special success (below) upon a target in place of a critical success, if desired.

### Special Success

An exceptional roll. A D100 result equal to 1/5 of your character’s skill rating. Often, a special attack means that the weapon does normal damage in addition to a special result based on the weapon’s type.

_For example, a bludgeoning weapon, like a club, has a knockback/down effect._

A special parry can do damage to an attacking weapon.

**_For example,_** _with Firearm 60%, your character achieves a special success on a roll of 04–12. This does normal damage (1D8, for example), but in the case of a firearm, also does impaling damage._

### Success

A good roll. This is a D100 result equal to or less than your character’s skill rating but higher than the result needed for a special or critical success. Attacks are successful if not parried or dodged, and damage is rolled normally, with no damage done to either attacking or parrying weapon.

**_For example,_** _with a skill of Firearm 60%, your character achieves a normal success on a roll of 13–60. For a firearm that deals 1D8 points of damage, the normal damage is rolled._

### Failure

A poor roll. A D100 result greater than your character’s skill rating but less than the highest 1/20 of chance of failure (see Fumble, below). Failing a combat roll means that the attempt failed, but your character can try again later in the same or a following combat round.

**_For example,_** _with a Firearm skill of 60%, your character fails on a roll of 61–97. No damage is rolled, and your target does not need to attempt to dodge or parry the attack._

### Fumble

A disastrous roll! A result of the highest 1/20 of the chance of failure, usually ranging from 96–100 for lower skill levels to a roll of 100 when character skill levels are over 100%. Often, a fumble indicates a dramatic mishap of some sort, and often forces a roll on the relevant fumble table. See the **Melee Weapon Attacks**, **Melee Weapon Parries**, **Missile Weapon Attacks**, and **Natural Attacks and Parries Fumbles Tables**.

**_For example,_** _with a Firearm skill of 60%, your character fumbles on a roll of 98–00. No damage is rolled, though you must roll on the **Missile Weapons Fumble Table** to determine the result of this botched attack._

Some weapons have their chance to malfunction (jam, lock up, etc.), expressed as a high result.

**_For example,_** _a musket always malfunctions on a roll of 95–00, regardless of the user’s skill._

Depending on the result of the same unfortunate roll and depending on your character’s skill rating, it is possible for your character to both fumble and have a weapon malfunction; to have a weapon malfunction without fumbling; or to have a fumble without a weapon malfunction.

**_For example,_** _your character has a skill of 60% with a musket and rolls 99 while firing it. Because the weapon malfunctions on a roll of 95–00, and your character normally fumbles on a roll of 98–00, this attack is unfortunately both a fumble and a weapons malfunction. If the roll had been a 95, 96, or 97, it would have only been a weapons malfunction._

If the result of a fumble specifies an attack on a target other than the intended one, and a malfunction causes a jam, the attack happens before the malfunction (see **Malfunctions**).

### Attack and Defense Matrix

|Attack Roll|Parry Roll|Dodge Roll|Result|
|---|---|---|---|
|Critical|Critical|Critical|Defender parries or dodges damage, no other result.|
|Critical|Special|Special|Attack partially deflected or dodged and achieves a success. Attacker strikes defender and rolls damage normally. Defender’s armor value subtracted from damage. Parrying weapon or shield takes 2 points of damage.*|
|Critical|Success|Success|Attack marginally deflected and achieves a special success. Attack does full damage** plus normal damage modifier and appropriate special result. Defender’s armor value subtracted from damage. Parrying weapon or shield takes 4 points of damage.*|
|Critical|Failure|Failure|Attack achieves a critical success. Attack does full damage** plus normal damage modifier (or attacker may choose a special success instead). Defender’s armor value is bypassed.|
|Critical|Fumble|Fumble|Attack achieves a critical success. Attack does full damage** plus normal damage modifier (or attacker may choose a special success instead). Defender’s armor value does not apply. Defender rolls on the appropriate fumble table.|
|Special|Critical|Critical|Defender parries or dodges attack; no other result. If attack is parried, attacking weapon takes 1 point of damage.*|
|Special|Special|Special|Defender parries or dodges attack, no other result.|
|Special|Success|Success|Attack partially parried or dodged and achieves a normal success. Defender’s armor value subtracted from damage. Parrying weapon or shield takes 2 points of damage.*|
|Special|Failure|Failure|Attack achieves a special success. Attack does full damage** plus normal damage modifier and appropriate special result. Defender’s armor value subtracted from damage.|
|Special|Fumble|Fumble|Attack achieves a special success. Attack does full damage** plus normal damage modifier and appropriate special result. Defender’s armor value subtracted from damage. Defender rolls on the appropriate fumble table.|
|Success|Critical|Critical|Defender blocks or dodges damage; no other result. If parried in melee combat, attacker’s weapon takes 2 points of damage.*|
|Success|Special|Special|Defender blocks or dodges damage; no other result. If parried in melee combat, attacker’s weapon takes 1 point of damage.*|
|Success|Success|Success|Defender blocks or dodges damage, no other result.|
|Success|Failure|Failure|Attack strikes defender and rolls damage normally. Defender’s armor value subtracted from damage.|
|Success|Fumble|Fumble|Attack strikes defender and rolls damage normally. Defender’s armor value subtracted from damage. Defender rolls on the appropriate fumble table.|
|Failure|—|—|No damage; no effect.|
|Fumble|—|—|Attack misses completely and attacker rolls on the appropriate fumble table. Defender unharmed.|

* If the parrying weapon or shield is destroyed during the parry attempt, roll the attacking weapon’s normal damage and subtract the points of damage used in destroying the parrying weapon or shield. The remaining damage penetrates the parry attempt to damage the defender (armor still protects). If the attacking weapon is destroyed during a successful attack, damage is still inflicted on the defender and the weapon is broken at that moment.

** This is the damage which that type of attack would normally do. This is not the same as ‘maximum damage’. For a greatsword, full damage is 2D8 on a normal success, 2D8 bleeding damage on a special success, and on a critical success it does 16 damage ignoring armor. Damage modifier, in all cases, is rolled separately and added afterwards.

### Special Successes and Damage

Different types of weapons do different types of damage upon special successes. There are five types of special damage: bleeding, crushing, entangling, impaling, and knockdown.

- **Bleeding:** A wound resulting in a deep tissue cut into arteries or major organs. Weapons with a sharp edge inflict bleeding damage.
- **Crushing:** A wound involving a blunt trauma to the victim, often breaking bones and stunning the target. Clubs, unarmed strikes, and other blunt weapons can cause crushing damage.
- **Entangling:** Pinning or otherwise ensnaring the target’s limbs or body. Flexible weapons, nets, ropes, and those with short, jagged points inflict entangling attacks.
- **Impaling:** A deep wound piercing vital organs or passing entirely through the body of the target. Firearms, arrows, and other pointed weapons inflict impaling damage.
- **Knockback:** A wound that unbalances and possibly sends the target sprawling backwards. Some forms of unarmed attacks and shield attacks cause knockback.

These five types of damage are described in the sections below.

### Bleeding

A special success with a slashing weapon inflicts bleeding damage on the target, who now has a vein or major artery severed and is rapidly losing blood. This does 1 additional hit point damage on DEX rank 1 of each round after the round in which the wound is inflicted. If fatigue points are used, the target loses 1 additional fatigue point each round they are bleeding. Armor protects against the initial attack, but not against the effects of bleeding.

While in combat, the target may try to staunch the bleeding once per round, essentially putting an empty hand over the wound and applying pressure. At the end of each round, the target can try a Stamina roll to determine if the bleeding stops. If successful, the wound is held closed, and the target will not suffer any more bleeding damage. While doing so, any attacks, parries, or physical actions they attempt are _Difficult_. Attempting to dodge cancels the attempt to stop the bleeding. If unsuccessful, the bleeding continues, and if the target dodges or does any strenuous activity, the bleeding begins again.

The most reliable way to stop bleeding damage is to make a successful First Aid roll on the injury. Success means that the bleeding stops and will not begin anew. Failure for this First Aid roll means that the bleeding continues until the target receives successful medical attention (in the form of a power or another skill like Medicine) or dies from blood loss when they reach 0 hit points.

If the bleeding is stopped for five combat rounds, it stops entirely on its own.

### Crushing

A special success with a crushing weapon—a club, staff, mace, or a particularly lucky unarmed strike—inflicts crushing damage upon the target. This is a particularly powerful blow, often causing massive bruising or even broken bones, frequently stunning.

A crushing special success doubles the damage modifier normally applied to the attack. If the attacker has a negative damage modifier, this becomes no damage modifier, and if there is no damage modifier, it becomes +1D4 (see the **Damage Modifier Table**). The weapon’s damage is rolled normally, but the damage modifier is increased.

A target suffering a crushing special success must also make a successful Stamina roll or be stunned for 1D3 rounds. Being stunned is a dizzying, disorienting experience, as stars dance in the target’s eyes and their head swims from the pain of the sudden blow. A stunned target cannot attack while stunned and can only attempt to dodge or parry an attack if they make a successful Idea roll for each attempt. Furthermore, all attacks against the target are _Easy_. The stunned target can attempt to flee, but to do so requires a successful Idea roll to discern an escape path and a successful Agility roll to get out of danger.

If the target successfully parries against a crushing special success attack, they risk their weapon or shield breaking. The attacker rolls damage and the increased damage modifier, and compares the damage rolled to the parrying item’s current hit points on the resistance table. The active value is the damage inflicted, and the passive value is the item’s normal hit points. If the active roll is successful, the parrying item takes all the damage from the blow, and any remaining damage is inflicted on the parrying target. The target may subtract armor protection from the damage done by the crushing blow but cannot further dodge or parry this attack—it automatically hits and the remainder of the damage is inflicted on the target. If the target takes damage, they are subject to the rules for stunning (above).

If the passive roll of the parrying item’s hit points is successful, it takes the normal attack damage directly to its hit points. If the parrying item takes more damage than it has hit points, it is destroyed by the attack—broken or shattered, whichever is appropriate—but the blow does not continue to strike the target.

If specific hit locations are being used and the parrying item was a shield, this further damage is automatically applied to the arm the target wore their shield upon, allowing for armor protection, if applicable. If the parrying item was a weapon, the further damage is applied to a random hit location, rolled by the gamemaster. As above, armor protection is still proof against the continued strike.

### Entangling

A special success with an entangling weapon—whip, net, chain, rope, man-catcher, etc. —entangles the target. An entangling attack cannot be made from close range and must be made with at least three meters of space between the attacker and target (though the garrote can be used at close quarters). A successful entangle prevents the target’s movement for the rest of the combat round and into the next combat round. This gives the attacker time to close with the target or otherwise subdue them.

This may prevent attacks by the target. Based on the nature of the entangling attack, the gamemaster may allow an entangled target a Luck roll to determine if they are able to attack.

**_For example,_** _a whip wrapped around one arm might allow the other arm and leg free attacks, while a lasso might immobilize both arms._

This should be handled on a case-by-case basis. However, there are few entangling attacks that do not allow for some method of attack, whether a kick or head butt.

If the attacker still has control over the entangling weapon (for example, a whip allows this, while bolas do not), the attacker can attempt one or more of the effects on the next round, as described in the Grapple skill. Allowable effects include: immobilize limb, immobilize target, throw target, knockdown target, disarm target, injure target, and strangle target, as appropriate. If hit locations are being used, this might disallow certain attacks.

**_For example,_** _a whip making an entangle on the leg cannot disarm a hand-held weapon._

On the round following a successful entangle attack, the target can attempt an Agility roll to free themselves or make a STR vs. STR resistance roll to attempt to pull the entangling weapon from the attacker’s hand(s). Alternatively, if the entangled target can, they may attempt an attack on the entangling weapon itself, cutting through it, if they have a cutting weapon equipped.

For entangling attacks employing flexible weapons such as nets, ropes, chains, and whips, a successful STR vs. STR resistance roll allows an entangling weapon to wrench a parrying weapon from the target’s grasp.

A successful Dodge roll or Wrestle roll negates a successful entangle but can only be attempted on the next combat round. A critical parry negates a critical entangle, but an ordinary parry success has no effect.

### Impaling

A special success with a pointed or thrusting weapon inflicts impaling damage upon the target, piercing deeply within flesh and potentially striking internal organs. An impale doubles the dice and modifier for the weapon’s normal rolled damage.

**_For example,_** _a short sword normally does 1D6+1 points of damage, while an impale with the same weapon does twice that, or 2D6+2 points of damage._

Only the weapon’s damage is doubled. If the attacker has a damage modifier, the damage modifier is not doubled, but is instead rolled normally and added to the damage.

An impaling weapon is still lodged in the target’s body until removed. If the weapon is a hand weapon, the attacker may immediately attempt a _Difficult_ weapon skill roll with the impaling weapon. If successful, the attacker can pull the weapon out after the impaling attack strikes home. Otherwise, the weapon is stuck in the body of the target.

If the attacker’s weapon is still in the wound, and the attacker wants it back, they must attempt to retrieve the weapon. In this case, the attacker must focus on pulling the weapon from the wound. This raises the chance of retrieval to the attacker’s full attack chance with the weapon, but any attacks against the attacker are considered _Easy_, and they obviously cannot parry or dodge while trying to extract their weapon from the target.

For thrown weapons such as javelins, daggers, or even arrows, the attacker must close with the target and succeed in a _Difficult_ Agility roll to grab the weapon. The chance to remove the weapon on succeeding rounds is the attacker’s full skill if the attacker wishes to ignore any attacks for that round and concentrate on retrieving the weapon, as described above.

An impaled target cannot be healed until the impaling weapon is removed, if it is larger than a knife. Tiny items such as arrowheads or bullets can be left in the wound, though this may present complications later, at the gamemaster’s discretion. If impaled with a weapon like a spear or sword, whenever the target moves in any significant fashion, they take half the weapon’s damage roll (roll again, without the damage modifier or armor protection) again (to the same hit location, if used) because the extruding weapon is catching on nearby surfaces, moving within them, and widening the wound, etc.

A target impaled with a weapon and attempting to remove it must make a resistance roll of their STR vs. the amount of damage dealt thus far by the weapon. Success means that the weapon has been freed and is in the hands of the target, while failure means that they are unable to free it that combat round and they take an additional 1D3 hit points of damage (to the same hit location, if used) from the activity. This action takes a full round and ends with the target holding the weapon that formerly impaled them.

The gamemaster may impose additional difficulties or reduce the effective STR by half, if the impaling weapon is in a position that would be difficult to reach or is otherwise inaccessible, such in the back.

Another means of dealing with an impaling weapon is to break or damage it so that it will not cause further distress but can be removed later. This is usually done with arrows, removing the shafts so they do not hinder any more. Depending on the weapon and the method of damaging it, this will require either a resistance table roll of the wounded target’s STR versus the weapon’s hit points, or an outright attack on the weapon itself.

Outside of combat, any attempt at removing an impaling weapon is _Easy_, either with the resistance roll or using First Aid.

### Knockback

A special success with an unarmed throw or a shield attack has knocked back the target. The total damage rolled (before armor is subtracted) is pitted against the target’s SIZ in a resistance roll. The gamemaster may lower the target’s effective SIZ to reflect unevenness of ground, slope, or the target’s condition (fatigued, stunned, etc.). If unsuccessful, the target is knocked back one meter for every 5 points of damage rolled (before armor), and the attacker must once again close and engage the target in melee combat if previously knocked out of melee combat range. If the knockback target also hits an obstacle in their path, they take 1D6 damage for every three meters or fraction thereof they have left to travel. The target must also make a successful Agility roll or fall prone (see **Prone**).

If the target wins the resistance roll, they are not moved, and if their SIZ is higher than the attacker’s SIZ, the attacker staggers back one meter.

### Fighting Defensively

If your character forgoes all attacks in a round to fight defensively, they can substitute one free Dodge attempt for their attack and can continue to make dodge or parry attempts. Normally, each subsequent Dodge or parry attempt is at a cumulative –30% modifier, but while fighting defensively, your character can substitute a Dodge skill attempt for an attack without incurring the –30% penalty. If they have already made Dodge attempts and parries and are at a negative modifier, the modifier does not increase. Essentially, it is a free Dodge attempt that does not incur a penalty on the next dodge or parry attempt.

The only restriction in this case is that your character cannot Dodge and parry within the same DEX rank. If your character can normally make multiple attacks per round (such as having a skill over 100%), they can make a second free Dodge or parry without incurring the cumulative penalty.

Under no circumstances can fighting defensively be combined with any attack or offensive action, even such as the **Desperate Action**.

### Fumbles in Combat

Fumbles in combat are unfortunate events or mishaps, attributable to bad luck or inexperience. When a fumble is rolled, roll D100 on the appropriate table and apply the result. The gamemaster rolls for nonplayer characters. If the result of the roll is inappropriate, the gamemaster should adapt it to something that makes sense, or reroll.

There are four fumble tables; use the most appropriate one to the action. Though the **Natural Weapon Attack and Parries Table** is intended to guide the actions of intelligent humanoids; with discretion it can also be useful for natural animals such as bears, wolves, etc. Again, the gamemaster is encouraged to adapt or reroll unlikely results.

Some weapons can **malfunction**. These occur in addition to any fumbles if the roll result overlaps the fumble and the malfunction ranges (see **Malfunctions**).

### Variant Combat Rules (Option)

These optional rules modify combat to better simulate combat in different genres, with some recommendations and advice about how these rules affect gameplay.

#### Attacks and Parries Over 100% (Option)

Your character may have skills over 100%, allowing for greater chances of critical results, special successes, and with combat skills, for multiple attacks in a round.

A combat skill rating of 100% or more lets your character split their attack into multiple attacks, though each attack must be at least 50%. These totals do not have to be equal. **_For example,_** _with a skill rating of 101%, your character can split attacks into one attack at 51% and one attack at 50%. With a skill rating of 151%, your character can split attacks into two attacks at 75% and 76%, one at 92% and another at 59%, or three at 50%, 50%, and 51%, etc. You cannot create fractions and round up—assign all skill rating to the attacks._

Your character can then make separate attacks with the same weapon, resolving each using one of the divided skill rating. The DEX rank for the first attack is normal; the DEX rank for the second is 5 DEX ranks lower; the third at 5 DEX ranks after that, etc. If this reduces an attack to DEX rank 0 or below, it cannot be attempted.

**Exceeding 100% in a Skill** provides information about how your character can achieve skills higher than 100%.

#### Dodging Missile Weapons (Option)

Normally, your character can only dodge missile weapons at a penalty or not at all (see **Dodge**), but in a more heroic game, your character can Dodge at their full skill rating, assuming that they have a chance to see the attacker and can get out of the way. This may even include dodging area attacks.

Furthermore, your character can attempt to parry missile weapons with hand weapons. A special or critical success is required to successfully parry a missile weapon with a hand weapon, and if the result is a normal success or even a failure, the attack automatically strikes your character.

Your character can also attempt to catch a missile weapon such as an arrow, spear, or other thrown weapon with a special or critical success on an Agility or Throw skill roll. In this case, your character has caught the weapon and escaped injury, and may dispose of it or utilize it in combat, as they see fit. If the roll is successful but not a special or critical success, your character has not caught it but is uninjured. If the roll is a failure, your character must make a successful Luck roll to avoid being injured, otherwise they take the missile weapon’s normal rolled damage. If the roll is a fumble, your character automatically takes the missile weapon’s rolled damage (to their hand/arm if hit locations are being utilized). Armor protection is allowed against this attack.

Your character can also parry high-velocity missile fire (arrows, bullets, etc.) freely with shields, as well, attempting a Spot roll beforehand. If the roll succeeds, your character may parry freely with their shield at full skill rating. If the Spot roll fails, the Parry roll is _Difficult_, or the skill rating defaults to the base chances provided in **Shields and Missile Fire**.

#### Dying Blows (Option)

The ability to strike one last time at a foe, despite a fatal wound, can be a dramatic and heroic finale for your character if mortally wounded, or a dismaying final strike by a hated opponent. The subject of a fatal blow (see **Damage and Healing**) can attempt one additional combat action if they make a successful Stamina roll. This action must take place on the next available DEX rank they are able to act, or if later, they must make an additional Stamina roll for each round their dying blow is deferred. Failing any of these rolls results in death before the dying blow is delivered.

The gamemaster is encouraged to allow a character’s dying blow to be performed at their full skill rating, minus any situational modifiers, such as being prone. At the gamemaster’s discretion, a dying blow does not have to be a combat action, but instead can be a final use of a power, a skill, or even some mundane action. It is recommended that a dying action be only a simple and direct task. Speaking final words to another character is a dying action, and requires a successful Luck roll for each relevant piece of information.

Once a dying blow is delivered or a dying action is performed, the character promptly passes on, having performed their final duty in the world. In such a case, the gamemaster may rule that medical attention afterwards automatically fails. The dying blow was the final capstone on a heroic death, or a villainous end.

This system replaces the **Desperate Action** spot rule.

## Armor

Armor is traditionally a form of clothing thick and tough enough to protect from attack. Historically, it was made from leather, bone, wood, and metal appropriate to the period. In the modern world, armor is made from ceramic and ballistic fibers, light metals, and other tough plastic-based substances, and in future eras, armor will likely be made of similar high-tech materials, or even energy-based protection. Though wearing it may cause fatigue, conventional armor does not require a skill roll or effort to be utilized. If an attack is not parried or dodged, armor is all that stands between your character and injury.

Armor’s most important aspect is its **armor value (AV)**. The higher the armor value, the better it protects the wearer. The armor value is subtracted from damage inflicted by a successful attack. The subject of the attack has the remaining damage removed from their hit points. If the result after armor value is subtracted is 0 or a negative number, no damage is taken.

Some types of armor can be layered over one another for greater effectiveness. Where shields are also used, a successful shield parry may not be enough to stop a blow, and damage from the attack can potentially pass through the armor value of the shield and to its wielder. In these cases, armor values for both shield and armor are subtracted before the parrying character takes damage.

### Disadvantages of Armor

Despite all the advantages, there are negative aspects to wearing armor. The following are the most significant, though the gamemaster may wish to emphasize some more than others, de-emphasize some of these aspects, or even introduce new conditions based on the setting:

- **Skill Penalties:** Armor can inhibit certain skills, particularly the Agility roll, or other Physical skill group skills such as Climb, Jump, Stealth, and Swim. Additionally, wearing a helmet may limit certain Perception skills. Some armor descriptions in _Chapter 8: Equipment_ include negative modifiers to these skills. Weapon skills are unaffected by wearing armor, as armor is crafted specifically to be used in combat.
- **Physical Discomfort:** Armor is heavy, uncomfortable, and inflexible, or at least more-so than normal clothing, and the weight of armor can fatigue and/or encumber its wearer. Fatigue and encumbrance cover clumsiness or any weariness from wearing armor. In desert or other hot environments, armor may be even more uncomfortable (see **Cold, Exposure, Hunger and Thirst** and **Fire and Heat**).
- **Social Issues:** Many types of armor are difficult to conceal and can be interpreted as hostile in many societies or cultures. Some Communication skills may become _Difficult_ based on the situation, as it is often difficult to persuade or manipulate someone when giving the appearance of being ready for violence. Other Communication skills may become _Easy_ for the same reason. These situations should be judged by the gamemaster.
- **Access:** Two other practical aspects limit the use of armor in a game setting: the availability of armor, and whether it fits. Availability should be judged by the gamemaster and based on the setting. For example, a quality mail shirt might be expensive but relatively easy to obtain in a medieval historical setting, while a practical and usable mail shirt might be next to impossible to find in a prehistoric or far-future setting. In some settings availability might seem unlimited (the modern world, for example), and access to actual armor might be as easy as an order online. The likelihood that the armor is of sufficient quality to withstand combat is not guaranteed however, and delivery may be restricted by regional laws and regulations.

_Chapter 8: Equipment_ covers all the specific advantages and disadvantages of armor and provides examples of many armor types, ranging from rawhide tunics to personal force fields. Additionally, several powers can modify your character’s armor value. These are discussed in _Chapter 4: Powers_.

### Armor and SIZ

Finally, not all armor is usable by everyone. Armor is usually rated by the SIZ it was crafted for, with the most comfortable armor being the most formfitting. Loose and ill-fitting armor is just as awkward to wear as armor that is too tight. Each armor type has a ‘Fits SIZ’ rating, expressed as a ± that determines the range of character SIZ above and below a particular suit of armor’s default SIZ. It is assumed that a character possesses or purchases armor suitable to their own SIZ, if given the choice. If your character’s SIZ is outside the range of the armor’s SIZ range, the armor cannot be worn.

Generally, the higher the armor value, the less likely it is to fit a character of another SIZ. If your character has an extreme SIZ one way or another (below 8 or above 16), they may be unable to wear much ‘off the rack’ armor (if it exists) and be forced to pay more for bespoke armor or seek alternative sources for defensive equipment.

### Shields

The easiest way to think of a shield is that it is a weapon whose primary purpose is to move between your character and an attacker. Shields do not cover the entire body but are both lighter than body armor and much cheaper and easier to manage. Shields do not generally lose hit points when struck by normal blows, and they are not very easy to knock free from a defender’s grasp. Usually, only powerful blows (special successes or better) will damage a shield, and the only way to lose one is through a fumble.

Different types of shields are described in _Chapter 8: Equipment_. Unlike weapon types, all shields use the same Shield skill, and the same skill rating applies to any shield used. Your character parries melee attacks with their shield just as they would a hand weapon. Against missile weapons, a half or small shield has a base 15% chance to block a missile, a full shield has a 30% chance to block a missile, and a large shield has a 60% chance. If your character kneels behind it, a full shield has a 60% chance to block a missile, and a large shield offers a 90% chance. These values are used in place of your character’s skill rating. See **Missile Weapons** and **Shields and Missile Fire**.

Under most circumstances, shields cannot effectively parry extremely fast missile weapons like firearms or energy weapons and are of limited use against hand-propelled weapons like arrows, sling stones, and spears. In these cases, a default chance is substituted instead of your character’s skill, but if allowed, see **Dodging Missile Weapons**.

Your character can also use a shield to attack an opponent. The chance is the same as your character’s Shield skill rating, as shield training usually incorporates offensive use as well as defensive. Shields generally use the knockback as their special success, though some types of shields are spiked and can use the impaling special successes.

If an attacker wishes to destroy an opponent’s parrying weapon or shield, they should make an attack as normal. If the target is not attempting to parry, the attack is an **Aimed Attack**. If the attack is a success and is successfully parried, or if the attack successfully strikes the shield as an aimed attack, damage is rolled normally (modified if it is a special or critical success). The shield’s armor value is subtracted from the damage done. Any excess damage is done to the shield. If the shield is reduced to 0 hit points, the remainder of the damage goes on to strike the defender. Armor will protect against this, and if the optional hit location system is used, the damage will be to the defender’s weapon or shield arm.

### Random Armor Values (Option)

Sometimes armor is unreliable and may not protect your character dependably each time they are struck in combat. Armor has gaps, spaces that are less armored, and some parts of your character’s body may not even be armored at all. Instead of a fixed armor value, random armor value simulates this unpredictability with a dice range, rolled whenever an attack that would do damage successfully strikes your character. This randomly-determined armor value is rolled and subtracted from any damage received. Armor value is rolled separately for each attack landing on your character, even in the same round. _Chapter 8: Equipment_ covers armor in detail and provides ranges for random armor values.

In games using random armor value, it is recommended that armor be generic rather than hit location specific, to minimize the bookkeeping per location.

## Missile Weapons

A weapon that is launched or hurled at a target is a **missile weapon**. This includes javelins, rocks, throwing knives, boomerangs, darts, or even hatchets. Weapons that use some form of mechanism to project a damage-causing element at a target, including firearms, bows, catapults, and even energy weapons, are also missile weapons.

Missile weapons are described in _Chapter 8: Equipment_. Some kinds of missile weapons such as bows and crossbows attack at a slower rate than your character can swing a hand-to-hand weapon, while firearms and other self-propelled weapons often attack at a faster rate. The attacks-per-round (Attk) column in the weapon tables shows how frequently attacks can be made with each type of missile weapon. For an increased rate of fire (a higher attacks-per-round), see **Volley Fire**.

Following are range modifiers for missile weapons:

- **Point Blank:** If the target is within the attacker’s DEX/3 meters (round up) (even if the target is prone), the skill is _Easy_.
- **Normal Range:** Unmodified if the target is within the weapon’s standard listed range.
- **Medium Range:** If the target is at double the weapon’s standard listed range, the attack is _Difficult_.
- **Long Range:** If the target is at quadruple the weapon’s standard listed range, the attack is 1/5 normal skill chance (equivalent to a special success, but if rolled, the result is a normal success).
- **Fast Moving Target:** –50%
- **Difficult Vision:** Light shadows –10%, light fog –25%, in darkness skills are _Difficult_ (see **Darkness**).
- **Concealment:** If the target is covered or partially concealed, skills are _Difficult_ (see **Cover**).
- **Prone at Distance:** If the target is prone at a range greater than attacker’s DEX/3 meters (round up), the attack is _Difficult_.
- **Targeting Gear:** Using long-range goggles, a scope, laser sight, or other targeting system divides range modifiers by 1/2 if one combat round is taken to aim.
- **Support:** If the weapon uses a fixed support (a bipod or tripod, suspensor sling, etc.), add +40% for the first attack if one round is taken to aim, then +20% for subsequent rounds.

Missile weapon fire cannot generally be dodged or parried with hand weapons. The only method of defense against missile weapon fire is to parry with a shield if the missile is slow enough to be seen in flight. Firearms and other projectiles are too fast for this, while arrows, javelins, and other hand-propelled weapons are all able to be parried with a shield (see **Shields and Missile Fire**). If using the optional rule for dodging and parrying missile weapon fire without restriction or hindrance, see **Dodging Missile Weapons**.

## Damage & Healing

Hit points measure the amount of injury your character can take and survive. When your character loses hit points through injury, this is called **damage**. You start with hit points based on your CON and SIZ characteristics, and these are reduced by the amount of damage you take. Wounds or other injuries, poisons, disease, and other forms of attack may cost your character hit points in damage. You should cross off lost hit points from the current hit point total shown on your character sheet, keeping track of each injury separately. Or circle the current amount based on each loss.

Poison and disease are special sorts of injury; they may attack randomly, and their effects may be delayed. Some cost hit points, while others target characteristic points or have other effects. The First Aid and Medicine skills can lessen or heal minor wounds and injuries. Various powers and gear can also restore hit points to characters.

Wounds are classified as **minor**, **major**, or **fatal**, and are described below.

### Minor Wounds

A **minor wound** is a single wound that costs your character up to half of their total hit points. It might be portrayed as a cut, a sprain, a mild poisoning, a small break or fracture, a mild concussion, or as a wound that soon closes. Minor wounds do not impair DEX or affect your character’s ability to think and to fight.

Your character may take several minor wounds on the same day. If the total hit points lost equal the amount of a major wound, your character must make a successful Luck roll or they will fall unconscious. This does not imply that the total of minor wounds causes a major wound: do not roll on the **Major Wounds Table** for multiple minor wounds. It means that your character has suffered an equivalent to a major wound but has not actually been inflicted with one. Additionally, if your character suffers minor wounds enough to reduce them to 1 or 2 hit points, this knocks them out for up to an hour. Each minor wound is a separate wound and can be dealt with separately by medical treatment as described in **Healing**.

### Major Wounds

When your character has sustained an injury equal to or more than half the character’s total hit points, they have suffered a **major wound**. Receiving a major wound risks suffering a permanent injury. When your character receives a major wound, roll on the **Major Wounds Table** or choose an appropriate result if hit locations are used. As noted in **Hit Locations**, major wounds are incompatible with hit locations without considerable gamemaster interpretation.

The effect of a major wound is immediate. Depending on the severity your character’s wounds, they may not be able to fight after the round of injury. See the **Major Wounds Table** for more details on this.

Even though your character may still be able to fight or has received some form of immediate medical attention, if they have suffered a major wound they go into shock. Because of this, your character can fight on only for combat rounds equal to their current remaining hit points.

**_For example,_** _if your character has taken a major wound and has 3 hit points remaining, they fall unconscious in three rounds._

A character possessing 2 or fewer hit points after suffering a major wound collapses immediately from shock and loss of blood and is unconscious for an hour. For the gamemaster, the unconsciousness provoked by a major wound often offers a secure way for nonplayer characters to abandon characters for dead or capture them rather than killing them outright.

Major wounds and their effects apply to player and nonplayer characters alike, along with animals, monsters, or other creatures. They do not apply to equipment, inanimate objects, or other beings that do not have a standard musculature (robots, immaterial, gelatinous, etc.). Such beings may suffer structural damage or operational difficulties, but this is up to your gamemaster’s discretion.

If your character has suffered a major wound, attempt a Luck roll immediately. If successful, the major wound will heal cleanly and does not inflict any permanent loss of characteristic points. If the Luck roll fails, the injury or wound is permanent. Your character suffers the full wound as described below, subtracting the indicated characteristic points.

Each injury description has multiple causes or specifics, allowing your gamemaster to select the most appropriate to the situation. Through training or other various means, your character can regain characteristic points lost from major wounds but will likely retain a significant scar (if applicable). When the characteristic point loss incurred by the major wound has been regained, any effects from the major wound are eliminated. If your character does not regain the characteristic point(s) lost, the characteristic loss imposed by the major wound is permanent. You should immediately recalculate your character’s characteristic rolls, hit points, damage modifier, fatigue points, etc. with the new characteristic totals.

When a limb is not specified, roll 1D6: a result of 1–3 is left, 4–6 is right.

#### Major Wound Table

|1D100|Result|
|---|---|
|01–10|Severed leg tendons cause limping; fused ankle bones cause limping; back muscles or spinal nerve damage bend the torso to the left or right; a shattered knee cannot bend; or make up a new wound effect. Lose 1D3 DEX and reduce MOV by the same amount. The character is still able to fight.|
|11–20|Much of the nose has been sliced away; multiple scars deface both hands; an ear has been cut off; a livid scar lends an evil cast to appearance; or make up a new wound effect. Lose 1D3 CHA. The visible and unappealing deformity cannot be disguised. The character is still able to fight.|

|00|Deliberately mutilated after collapsing. Remove 1D4 points each from four characteristics (gamemaster’s discretion). The character is unable to fight.|

### Fatal Wounds

A **fatal wound** is one that does more hit points in damage than your character has currently. If an injury reduces your character to 0 or negative hit points, they have suffered a fatal wound. Your character is immediately knocked **prone** but unable to take any action of any type.

Fatal wounds lead to death, though they may be averted with immediate successful medical assistance. If a fatally wounded character receives medical attention (First Aid, Medicine, a power, an item, etc.) in the round they received the fatal wound or the round immediately after, and their hit points are brought up to 1 or more, they have almost died, but survive that particular injury.

### Damage and hit Locations (Option)

If the optional hit location syste is used, your character’s hit points are distributed among various bodily areas but are also tracked as a single ‘pool’ of hit points. This system is incompatible with **Major Wounds** and the two systems should not be used together.

The individual hit points per location add up to more than your character’s normal hit point total. Keep track of each wound and each location separately, but also keep a running total of all hit point damage your character has suffered. Regardless of how many points remain in individual hit locations, if the combined hit point loss is enough to reduce your character to 1 or 2 hit points, they fall unconscious and at 0, they will die if they do not receive immediate medical attention.

As noted in the initial section on hit locations, a hit location can take up to its hit points in damage without inconvenience. **_For example,_** i_f your character has 5 hit points in their leg hit location, they can take up to 4 hit points of damage in a leg without being disabled._ However, when a hit location takes all or more than its hit points in damage, the effects can be debilitating or even fatal.

The reference to ‘medical attention’ can be the First Aid or Medicine skills, healing magic or technology, or use of an appropriate power.

#### Damage Equal to or More Than the Location’s Hit Points

- **Leg:** The limb is temporarily useless, and your character falls prone. They are unable to act for the rest of the round but may act while prone in following rounds. See **Prone** for effects.
- **Abdomen:** Both legs are temporarily useless. Your character falls prone but may act while prone in subsequent melee rounds. If your character has the means to heal themselves, they can do so. If not healed or treated with First Aid within ten minutes (two turns), your character bleeds to death, losing 1 hit point per round if they do not make a Stamina roll to stop the bleeding.
- **Chest:** Your character falls and is too busy coughing blood to do perform any action, including healing. They will bleed to death in ten minutes (two turns), losing 1 hit point per round unless receiving medical attention or stopping the bleeding with a successful Stamina roll.
- **Arm:** The limb is temporarily useless, and anything not attached to the arm is dropped. Your character can continue to stand and fight with whatever limbs are still functional.
- **Head:** Your character is knocked unconscious and must receive medical attention within five minutes (one turn) or make a successful Stamina roll to stabilize. If neither happens, they die.

#### Damage Equals or Exceeds Double the Location’s Hit Points

- **Limb:** Your character cannot take more than twice the possible points of damage in an arm or leg from a single blow. **_For example,_** _a 2-point arm hit for 5 points takes only 4 points of damage off the total hit points: the remaining 1 point of damage has no effect. However, further blows to that arm affect the total hit points of your character._ However, a character so damaged from a single blow is functionally incapacitated: they can no longer fight until healed and are in shock. They may try to heal themselves. Bleeding occurs at a rate of 1 hit point per round until receiving successful medical attention or a _Difficult_ Stamina roll.
- **Head, Chest, or Abdomen:** If the head, chest, or abdomen suffers more than twice as much damage as it has hit points in that location, your character becomes unconscious and begins to lose 1 hit point per melee round unless receiving medical attention or making a successful _Difficult_ Stamina roll.

#### Damage Equals or Exceeds Triple the Location’s Hit Points

- A limb hit for three times more points than it can take in a single blow is severed or irrevocably maimed. **_For example,_** _if your character has a 2-point arm and is struck for 8 points, they take only 4 points of damage against their total hit points. However, the arm is maimed. In these cases, your character is also functionally incapacitated._
- A head, chest, or abdomen hit for three times as much damage as there are hit points in that location results in instant death.

#### Severed and Maimed Limbs

- Only drastic medical attention can restore a severed limb, assuming all parts are available, such as some extremely powerful magic, technology, or serious surgery followed by months of recovery.
- The maiming or severing of a limb can be permanently damaging. If your character no longer has part of a limb, they lose 1 hit point in that location. Your gamemaster should work with you to discuss options appropriate to the setting, whether cybernetics, powerful magic, or more drastic measures.
- Use the guidelines for **Major Wounds** to determine any characteristic loss.

### Healing Naturally

Most living creatures heal naturally, given enough time and a relatively stress-free environment. Your character will normally heal 1D3 hit points per game week. This is the normal healing rate. Usually, your gamemaster rolls the healing rate dice and tells you the results. Each week, make a different roll to determine how many hit points are restored. As the healing rate can vary depending on each character, the die result can change from week to week. Your character will keep healing each week until all their hit points have been restored.

The result of the week’s healing is granted at the end of the week (consisting of seven days), but if time is of the essence, your gamemaster may choose to divide the healing rate across the days of the week, such as dividing the week by result of the die roll and announcing that each hit point is restored in that many days (round up).

Remove the recovered hit points from existing injuries, spreading the healing between multiple wounds as evenly as possible. The First Aid or Medicine skills or other remedies can speed recovery. A successful First Aid roll immediately restores 1D3 hit points per wound or injury. The Medicine skill may be used to offset the effects of major wounds (described earlier) and can be used to restore hit points lost through means other than injuries. A wide variety of medical equipment and other means (such as healing powers) can be utilized to aid in the healing process.

Finally, the quality of medical care the patient receives each week may increase their healing rate significantly. The Conditions of **Medical Care Table** offers guidelines for various conditions and the effect on the healing rate.

#### Conditions of Medical Care

|Medical Conditions|Effect on Healing Rate|
|---|---|
|Poorly equipped, unsanitary, and/or full of stressful elements; patient is mobile and exerting self heavily (combat, rugged travel, etc.); or receiving no medical care whatsoever.|Caregiver (doctor, nurse, healer, self, etc.) must succeed in a _Difficult_ First Aid or Medicine roll for any healing to occur. If successful, the patient heals normally (1D3 hit points/week); if unsuccessful no healing occurs. A fumble inflicts 1D3 additional hit points in damage.|
|Decent and sanitary conditions, restful environment, care provided, only moderate physical exertion.|The patient heals 1D3 hit points naturally.|
|Excellent conditions and equipment utilized, environment conducive to healing and restoration, full bedrest and therapy, full-time high-quality medical care provided.|The patient heals 1D3 hit points naturally; a further successful First Aid or Medicine skill use allows possible additional healing.|

### Miniatures, Maps, and Virtual Tabletops

Movement and positioning in hand-to-hand combat are challenging elements to keep track of in roleplaying games. While some players and gamemasters are less concerned with particulars during combat, some feel the need to keep track of the relative positions of the player characters and their adversaries. Using figures, tokens, or markers on a map can answer any questions, presenting a concrete means of determining what is happening and where.

Roleplaying miniatures are small plastic or metallic statuettes about several centimeters high, available at most game and hobby stores or online. There is an enormous variety of character types, costumes, genres, historical periods, and poses, and collecting, assembling, and painting miniatures is a pleasant side hobby.

To keep track of movement, maps with grids of squares or hexagons are often useful. These come in sheets of various sizes made of paper or sturdier materials. Stores that carry miniature figures also probably carry these. Some players dislike grids as rigid, confining, or mechanistic, and prefer to eyeball distances and negotiate movement, using rulers or tape measures as last resorts. You may want to experiment, to see what suits you. A gamemaster who uses miniatures or maps will want a few larger sheets of paper to use for sketching out floor plans and creating simple maps. Players may find graph paper useful in mapping ruins or buildings. Mapmaking programs specialized for roleplaying games make this increasingly easy, and pre-made maps and tile sets are readily available.

Online tabletops allow for entire game sessions to be played online, with gamemaster tools, player storage of character sheets, and battle maps that also have sound effects, lighting, dice rolling apps, and even more, letting gamemasters and players automate this aspect of play and allow for immersive play with players anywhere they can use their computers. These range from top-down simple map programs to 3D environments, customizable by the gamemaster, with ‘modules’ of content available, including adventure and other aspects useful to play.

## A Combat Example

The following example is set in a fantasy world and describes how the warrior Yvarre has stolen a priceless amulet from the treasure chamber of a sinister cult of serpent-worshippers and is trying to escape the temple to where her ally Kallistor is waiting.

### First Combat Round

Tucking the enormous jewel-studded golden amulet into her waistband, Yvarre slips out of the cult’s treasure room and silently moves down the passage beyond, hoping to avoid notice while she gets to where her friend Kallistor waits with a couple of horses.

As she moves down the corridor, a dagger is thrown at Yvarre from behind. The gamemaster rolls a success and says that Yvarre has been struck high on her left shoulder (the optional hit location system is not being used. this is just the gamemaster elaborating with flavor in their description). The gamemaster rolls 1D4+2+1D2, the damage that the dagger does plus half the thrower’s damage modifier. Luckily for Yvarre, the gamemaster gets a 4 on the damage roll, the lowest possible result.

Yvarre wears a soft leather tunic (armor value 1) and has 17 hit points. Her armor protects her from 1 point of damage, so Yvarre loses 3 hit points, not 4. She’s now down to 14 hit points, so her player carefully crosses out the numbers 17,16, and 15, and circles the 14 on Yvarre’s character sheet.

She glances back and sees a serpent priest drawing another dagger from his sleeve as he approaches.

### Second Combat Round

Cursing at her bad luck, Yvarre enters the chamber and bolts the door behind her, then reaches around to examine her wound. Fortunately, the attack was not an impaling one, so the blade is not stuck deeply in her shoulder. Next, she attempts to treat the wound with First Aid. Yvarre’s First Aid skill is 47%: her player rolls a 99—a fumble!

A roll on the fumble table is not necessary: the penalty for a fumble with First Aid is always the loss of 1 hit point of damage. The gamemaster says that Yvarre did herself an extra point of damage in pulling at the wound, due to the awkward location. The wound is wider now, and blood from it drenches the back of her soft leather tunic (again, this is not a result of a special damage result: it’s just flavor for the players to help them visualize the scene).

Yvarre’s player sighs and crosses off another hit point. Yvarre now has 13 hit points.

### Third Combat Round

Muffled thuds come from the bolted door. Yvarre wheels and goes to the window through which she entered. She takes hold of the rope she had hung there, preparing to climb down. The gamemaster holds up a hand to halt the player’s description and injects, “Yvarre notices that the rope feels very light. Does she want to see why?”

She does, the player says, and has Yvarre pull up the line. Yvarre’s escape rope ends a meter beneath the sill. It has been cut, likely by someone leaning out the window below.

Yvarre is trapped unless she decides to jump to the street. The gamemaster says, “Make a Spot roll to find out if Yvarre notices something.” In this case, the ‘something’ the gamemaster is referring to is a cult assassin on the roof top opposite Yvarre, readying his bow for an attack.

The player rolls D100 for Yvarre’s Spot skill and fails. Since Yvarre doesn’t notice the cult assassin, the gamemaster rolls 43, a hit, and then rolls for damage, 1D8+1, but no damage modifier. The gamemaster rolls 9 in damage, which will be reduced by 1 for Yvarre’s armor. “Is that enough for a major wound?” the gamemaster inquires. The player nods glumly. She marks off 8 more hit points on her character sheet, lowering her remaining hit points to 5.

Yvarre’s player rolls on the major wound table, getting a result of 27, and the gamemaster says that the arrow struck Yvarre in the left arm. Yvarre’s Luck roll succeeds, so the wound will not become a permanent injury. Yvarre feels herself weakening, the gamemaster says. She’ll become unconscious in four combat rounds, one round for each hit point she currently possesses.

At the other end of the room, the door to the hallway is beginning to splinter. Yvarre could use the next round to try to apply First Aid to this new wound, but she can’t afford the time.

### Fourth Combat Round

If Yvarre stays in the room, she’ll soon be at the mercy of the serpent-worshipping cult, not something to look forward to. It’s 6 meters down to the ground, and Yvarre’s player realizes that in her condition the fall could kill her. However, the player also knows that Yvarre herself would never hesitate. “I jump,” she says. The archer takes another shot. Missile fire cannot be dodged, so Yvarre hopes for the best. She’s in luck—the arrow misses.

“Make your Jump roll, please.” The result is a 21, a success. “Okay”, says the gamemaster, “now roll 1D6 for the damage reduction.” She gets a 3, to be subtracted from any damage incurred in the fall to come. “And now roll 2D6 for the fall damage.” Her dice total 5. Yvarre had 5 hit points. She loses 5, but the successful Jump roll saves 3. Yvarre now has 2 hit points left.

At 2 hit points, Yvarre automatically falls unconscious. This is not more than half her total hit points, so there is no new major wound.

### Fifth Combat Round

In the night-black alley, Yvarre’s friend Kallistor hears her hit the ground and finds her motionless on the cobblestones. Listening to the approaching shouts, Kallistor’s player decides to throw Yvarre across the saddle of one horse and mount the other, fleeing immediately.

### Sixth Combat Round

A few streets distant, Kallistor feels safe enough to stop for a round. He uses the magic spell Healing 1 on Yvarre’s knife wound. Kallistor’s spell restores 3 hit points to Yvarre (a roll of 3 on 1D6) and the gamemaster rules that Yvarre is now conscious and able to ride but is very weak. Kallistor’s player marks off 3 power points for the use of the spell (which costs 3 power points per level used). Kallistor has 14 power points, so it puts him down to 11.

### Several Combat Rounds Later

After some evasive riding through town to prevent followers, the gamemaster says that no pursuit is evident. The two adventurers reach their hideout. Inside, safe for the moment, Kallistor uses First Aid to try to heal the arrow wound, raising her hit points to 7.

### Next Combat Round

Yvarre also took fall damage. Kallistor’s First Aid was for the knife wound, but Yvarre’s First Aid roll works on the general bruising from the fall. The 2 points of fall damage are erased. The injury is still present, but no longer has practical consequence. Now Yvarre is at 9 hit points.

### Next Combat Round after That

Kallistor’s unsuccessful First Aid attempt fails to heal the dagger damage, as has Yvarre’s previous attempt.

### One More Combat Round

Kallistor uses Healing 2 on Yvarre’s arrow wound, restoring 4 points out of a possible 12. Yvarre is now at 13 hit points, and Kallistor is now down 6 more power points, leaving him at 5 power points total. Neither of them is in dire shape, but Yvarre is not at full hit points and Kallistor has used up several power points.

The dagger wound will heal naturally in a week, and the remaining damage from the arrow wound will take at least two weeks. Kallistor wants to keep some power points in reserve in case of emergency. He’ll try the spell later, when he’s got more power points or when the coast is clear.

### After Combat

At this point, there is little reason to continue using combat time, so everyone switches into narrative time in which the player behavior and gamemaster narration becomes more relaxed.

Her wounds and injuries attended to for the moment, Yvarre reaches into her waistband to pull out the amulet. It seems to twist in her hands, as she does so, so she lets it go. As it hits the ground, the amulet breaks into dozens of tiny jewel-eyed golden snakes that fall to the ground and slither away.

All that, and for nothing!
