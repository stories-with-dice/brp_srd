# 4. Powers

Characters may have extraordinary powers above and beyond their skills. While _Chapter 2: Characters_ provides guidelines for creating characters without powers, this chapter covers those with powers. Several power sets are presented here. Some are not immediately compatible with one another, while others are easily used together.

## Power Sets

Included here are five power sets: magic spells, mutations, sorcery, psychic abilities, and superpowers:

- **Magic:** Spells are cast like skills, using percentile rolls to determine success. Spells can be made more powerful in various ways, usually by spending more power points. A magician usually has a small number of spells they use frequently.
- **Mutations:** Modifications or special abilities that accentuate or expand capabilities beyond human norms, like an extra limb, toxins, or a heightened sense of smell. Unlike other power sets, some mutations are not beneficial and are even hindrances.
- **Psychic Abilities:** Strange powers of the mind, manifest through mental strength and force of will. Psychic abilities are usually resolved as resistance rolls with your INT or POW vs. an opposing characteristic. A psychic may have a few or many abilities they’re relatively powerful in.
- **Sorcery:** This type of magic consists of short magical incantations that cause a supernatural effect. Sorcery automatically works except when successfully resisted and can have different levels of effectiveness. A sorcerer can change the spells they memorize day-to-day, picking desired ones from a larger repertoire. Seeking new spells is a part of playing a sorcerer.
- **Superpowers:** These powers are almost always expansions of existing skills, new abilities, or allow your character to exceed their natural limits (characteristics, etc.) significantly. Superpower use is often resolved with resistance rolls, though some superpowers are automatic. Superpowers and super-powered characters may take on advantages or disadvantages.

### The Scope of these Rules

These powers are adapted from prior Chaosium, Inc. games (see the bibliography in _Chapter 12: Appendices_). They are not all-encompassing: expansion and customization is encouraged. These are a foundation with which you can create additional new powers or adapt them freely from other sources such as movies, books, or even other roleplaying games. More easily, you can import powers from other Basic Roleplaying games, if you wish!

### Opposed Powers of Different Types

Though these power sets use different fundamental mechanics they can coexist within the same game. Superhero settings can have magicians, mutants, psychics, and sorcerers, for example. Usually, these can coexist without difficulty, but the most critical question is when they come into conflict or must be compared against one another. When using these powers in the same game, consider these principles:

- **Can You Use the Resistance Table?** Whenever possible, can any conflicts between powers be handled by resistance rolls? For resistance rolls, POW usually drives magic, sorcery, and psychic powers; CON is linked to most mutations; and superpowers use several characteristics. In some cases, the power’s levels are all you need for a resistance roll.
- **Can You Find an Equivalent Rule?** If the power isn’t based on a characteristic, you may find an equivalent value as a piece of equipment in _Chapter 8: Equipment_, or a spot rule from _Chapter 7: Spot Rules_. If so, use one of those.
- **What’s More Fun?** Which is better for game play; do different powers work together, even when from different sets, or are they completely different and do not interact?

## How Do Characters Get Powers?

The most important questions to ask during character creation are:

- How did the characters get these powers?
- What kind of powers, and how many?
- How _powerful_ are these powers?
- Are there any limitations, and if so, what are they?

Your gamemaster should answer these questions during the character creation process outlined in _Chapter 2: Characters_. Power creation can be done after that section is complete, though decisions made about powers and opportunities for increases to characteristics and skills may necessitate refiguring of those values.

### Selecting Powers in Character Creation

Ideally, the decision about powers is decided before character creation, so players can determine their powers right after **Step One** in **Creating a Character** in _Chapter 2: Characters_. Use this process to determine your character’s powers, expanding and replacing **Step Two**.

### Step Two (Powers)

What is the game’s power level? You and your gamemaster should discuss this and agree to it, which leads to shared expectations and satisfaction between everyone. These are the usual power levels:

- **Normal:** Characters have no, one, or a few minor powers, sometimes barely more than an extraordinary talent. This power level is the most suitable for horror or modern adventure settings, where technology and wits are often the decisive factor in survival.
- **Heroic:** Characters have a few strong powers or a wide range of mid- to low-level powers. This level of power is best for games about young superheroes or apprentice wizards, mutated survivors of a radioactive apocalypse, historical vigilante heroes, or a high fantasy world of wizards and warriors. In vastly advanced civilizations or eras, normal citizens may have this power level, with many incredible abilities granted by genetic manipulation or now-unknown scientific principles.
- **Epic:** Characters are at the level of costumed superheroes, arch-mages, or formidable supernatural beings. Games like this are high-stakes, often with the fate of the world in the balance, and epic-level characters are well-suited for these challenges.
- **Superhuman:** These characters are primal beings or the mightiest of heroes. Games at this power level might feature the upper echelon of costumed superheroes, galactic guardians, modern incarnations of great demigods, or all of them fighting side-by-side.

Each power set covers the powers available to a starting character at each power level.

### Mixing Power, Characteristic, and Skill Levels

A game’s power level does not necessarily define the starting skill point pools described in **Step Seven** of character creation. You can mix and match skill levels and power levels as desired.

**_For example,_** _superhero characters may have tremendous power, but normal starting skill points, or vice versa._

Doing so lets you customize game as you like to suit your preferred play style.

### Powered Characters vs. Non-Powered Characters

Should all the characters in a game have powers, or is it all right if some do and some don’t? This depends on the players and your desired play style—some players may feel cheated if their characters don’t have equal abilities from the start, while others enjoy the challenge and differences between characters.

These rules assume that every player has access to the same resources to create their character. Not everyone wants to play the same type of character with the same power set, though. Following are a few options to help balance powered and non-powered characters, characters with different power sets, or those with different power levels:

- **Skills vs. Powers:** Vary the power levels of skills vs. powers, such as lowering the power level of the powered character by one step or raising the skill level any non-powered characters by one step, as appropriate.

**_For example,_** _powered characters in a Heroic level game begin at a Normal level for powers and skills, while everyone else has Heroic level skill pools._

That said, it is almost impossible to balance all the potential combinations. The most important thing is to make certain that all the players are happy and things seem fair.

- **Obvious vs. Intrinsic Powers:** Many powers are subtle, and could be defined as just exceptional knacks, or superlative ability or training. Many powers can be explained as the natural result of heightened training, special capabilities, intense mastery, or exceptional mental or physical discipline.
- **Equipment:** You can substitute physical items for powers. _Chapter 8: Equipment_ covers the creation of weapons, armor, vehicles, and other pieces of gear that may have their own powers and skills, with rules as to how they may be purchased like powers. Characters may have other advantages such as secret bases, vast wealth, armies of loyal followers, or other resources. Some guidelines are in the equipment section, though these sorts of advantages are best handled between you and your gamemaster.

With any one or more of these methods in use, a seemingly non-powered character should be able to be created alongside a character that obviously possesses an array of powers. For example, a super archer character may personally have few powers, but instead an array of technological trick arrows that simulate superpowers.

### Characters With More Than One Type of Power

More than one power set may be available to characters, whether starting or more experienced.

**_For example,_** _your character may be a super-powered telepathic mutant, or use both magic and sorcery, or perhaps even use all five types of powers presented in this chapter._

However, your gamemaster should have the final say as to whether your character can begin with more than one power set.

Following are guidelines for beginning with more than one power set, by power level.

### Normal Power Level

Your character begins with:

- One power set at the Normal power level

### Heroic Power Level

Your character begins with (pick one of the following):

- One power set at the Heroic power level
- Two power sets at the Normal power level

### Epic Power Level

Your character begins with (pick one of the following):

- One power set at the Epic power level
- One power set at the Heroic power level and one power set at the Normal power level
- Three power sets at the Normal power level

### Superhuman Power Level

Your character begins with (pick one of the following):

- One power set at the Superhuman power level
- One power set at the Epic power level and one power set at the Normal power level
- One power set at the Heroic power level and two power sets at the Normal power level
- Two power sets at the Heroic power level
- Four power sets at the Normal power level

As is often the case, having multiple power sets may not be as useful as a single higher-level power set. The more powers and skills your character uses often spreads them thin and may result in slower advancement. And no matter how many of these power sets your character may use, they all draw from the same pool of power points—your character does not keep a different power point pool for each power. In some cases, such as an item that stores power points, your character may not even be able to access those power points to use different types of powers.

**_For example,_** _a technological battery that stores power points might not work for spells or for psychic powers… or does it?_

## Magic

Characters who use magic spells are called magicians, and these rules refer to them as such. Magicians use chants and gestures to produce immediate magic effects. Magic is quick and easy, drawing from the magician’s POW and using it for resistance rolls, where required.

### How Magic Works

Magic is treated like any other skill: each spell a magician knows is a different skill, with a percentage chance for success. The magician spends power points (based on their POW) to fuel spells. When a magician casts a spell, they spend the relevant power points, and percentile dice are rolled. If successful, the spell takes effect. If the roll fails, 1 power point is lost and nothing happens.

Like skills, a spell can have an additional effect with a special or critical roll. See **Magic Spell Success Levels** for guidance about each level of success.

Most of the time, the magician can attempt to cast the spell again on the next round if they have enough power points remaining.

Magic can be learned from an instructor and improved through experience. If using **Skill Category Bonuses**, spells are Mental skills and that modifier is applied.

### Costs of Magic

Magic spellcasting always has a cost. Magic spells can also be cast in increments, called levels. Generally, each level costs 1 power point to cast. Some spells cost more than 1 power point per level. If a magician is reduced to 0 power points, they fall unconscious. The normal rules for power points apply to any power points lost through casting spells. Even if the roll to cast a spell is a failure, the spell costs 1 power point. If the roll fumbles, the spell costs the same amount as if it was a success (costing the number of levels in the spell).

Power points regenerate as per the **Power Point Recovery Rate Table**. Usually, this is 1 per hour if sleeping and 1 per 2 hours if awake and active.

### Casting Time

Only one spell can be cast per combat round, but a magician can cast several levels of the same spell together in the same attempt. Spells each cost 1 DEX rank to cast per level of the spell and are considered as attack actions if cast in combat.

**_For example,_** _if a magician with DEX 15 wants to cast a spell in a combat round, the spell is cast at the DEX rank –1 per level of the spell. Thus, a level 1 spell is cast at DEX rank 14 (15–1=14)._

A magic spell with more levels is cast later in the round. _Chapter 6: Combat_ covers spell casting times, and the following sections describe magic spell levels in more detail.

### Spell Level

Each spell is expressed with a level that determines how powerful it is. By default, a spell is level 1, costing 1+ power points to cast. A spell can be made even more powerful by adding additional levels (and power points). The effect of each additional level is provided in each spell’s description.

Adding more levels takes longer than casting the spell at level 1. Each level of a spell lowers the magician’s DEX rank by –1 for the combat round.

_For example, a magician with DEX 15 casting a Fire spell at level 2 does so at DEX rank 13 (15–2=13) rather than the normal DEX rank 14._

There is a limit to how many levels can be added to a spell, equal to ½ your character’s INT (rounded up).

**_For example,_** _a magician with INT 15 is limited to spells of levels 1 through 8. If the additional time to cast lowers their DEX rank to below 0, the spell is cast in the next round, subtracting the number below 0 from their normal DEX rank in that next round._

This likely only occurs if a magician’s DEX rank is low or has been lowered due to other activities in the combat round.

### Overcoming POW

Any time a spell affects a living target, the caster must overcome the target’s POW or power points in a resistance roll. Each spell description designates which value is used. If it is power points, the value is determined before any points are spent on the spell. This is not required if the target of the spell is willing to accept the spell’s effects, and beneficial spells such as Heal or Enhancement do not require a resistance roll unless the recipient actively does not wish to be aided. In these cases, use a resistance roll. An unconscious or otherwise debilitated target automatically fails a resistance roll using POW or power points.

### Combining Spells

Two low-level spells of the same type cannot be combined to make a higher-level spell.

**_For example,_** _a magician cannot combine two Protection 2 spells to make a Protection 4 spell._

If two or more spells of unequal levels are applied to the same person, place, or thing at the same time, only the higher-level spell takes effect, though all the power points to cast those spells are still spent. If the durations overlap, the lower-level spell takes effect for the remainder of its duration once the higher-level spell has expired, if it has not expired already. At no time do two or more of the same spells apply to the same subject at the same time.

### Memorization of Magic

A magician must commit spells to memory to use them and can memorize a number of spells equal to half their INT (round up). For example, a magician with INT 15 can memorize eight spells at a time (15×½=7.5, rounded to 8). Any other spells the magician wishes to carry and have available must be carried in their grimoire, a type of spellbook used by magicians. It takes 1 hour for a magician to memorize a spell, and if their INT is already full, one or more spells currently memorized must be forgotten. Memorizing a magic spell is called **readying it**, while forgetting it is called **dismissing it**. Dismissing a spell also takes 1 hour. Spells remain memorized until dismissed, even if the magician sleeps or is rendered unconscious by force or some other means.

### Grimoires

A magician can cast a spell directly from their grimoire, but this takes one combat round per level of spell effect desired. A magician can use another character’s grimoire if they can read it (with a successful Language roll) and can make a successful roll of INT×1 for each spell they attempt to use. If they fail either roll, they cannot understand the other magician’s grimoire, with its occult codes, unfamiliar symbology, and idiosyncratic style of organization. After such a failure, the magician can get no other knowledge out of the grimoire. If their Language skill in the relevant language increases through training or experience, they can attempt to read the spellbook again. Once a spell is successfully read, it can be re-read (and potentially memorized) without rolling, though it must be cast normally.

Some magicians can be illiterate, with non-textual means of transcribing a spell, whether through pictographs, tattoos, occult symbols on great stone columns, or another means. Your gamemaster should work out how accessible these alternate methods are to the magician and others.

### Initial Spells by Power Level

A magician automatically knows how to ready, memorize, and dismiss spells, and can freely add any currently memorized spells to their grimoire at any time (or can transcribe any currently memorized spells to a new grimoire if the original is destroyed or lost). The magician can spend skill points from **Step Three** of character creation, and **Step Seven** if they have an appropriate profession (Occultist, Priest, Shaman, or Wizard) for spells.

Following are the starting spells by game power level:

- **Normal:** A magician knows four spells of their choice, with a beginning skill equal to INT×1.
- **Heroic:** A magician knows six spells at INT×1.
- **Epic:** A magician knows eight spells at INT×1. If desired, the magician begins with a familiar (the POW cost is assumed in the past, so no need to adjust).
- **Superhuman:** A magician begins with 10 spells at INT×1, a wizard’s staff already constructed (its power points are based on their current POW score—the sacrifice of POW is assumed, no need to adjust), and a familiar of their choosing (as above).

The normal restrictions for having spells in memory apply, and all known spells are available in the magician’s grimoire.

### The Magician’s Familiar

**Base Range:** The magician’s POW in meters.

A magician may have a familiar, a special animal or creature with an magical connection to the magician. A familiar aids in magic and provides other useful abilities. To gain a familiar, a magician must first capture or befriend the appropriate animal. See _Chapter 11: Creatures_ for examples, or you and your gamemaster can devise a new creature, as desired. The creature’s SIZ cannot be more than ¼ the magician’s POW, rounded up. **_For example,_** _a magician with POW 16 is limited to creatures of SIZ 4 or lower. All magicians are taught the ritual of binding a familiar, though your gamemaster may require an untutored magician to seek the knowledge out in some grimoire or from a mentor._

Once the creature is captured, the magician must live closely to it for three months. During this time, they cannot be apart for more than one day. Each day of these three months is spent in ritual preparation, establishing a supernatural rapport with the creature. At the end of this process, the magician must spend 1 point of permanent POW and defeat the creature in a POW vs. POW resistance roll (using the POW value before the point is spent). This is known as binding. When the ritual is completed, all the magician’s current power points are expended, but now they have an unbreakable magic link with the creature. If the resistance roll fails, the creature can never be taken for a familiar, and the POW point is lost.

A successfully-bound familiar is unfailingly loyal to the magician and never willingly betrays them. The magician always senses where their familiar is (and vice versa) unless they are somehow magically shielded from each other.

While the familiar is within range (the magician’s POW in meters), the magician can:

- Drain the familiar of some or all power points to use instead of the magician’s own. If the creature is reduced to 0 power points, it falls unconscious.
- Drain the familiar of some or all fatigue points, using them instead of the magician’s own. If the creature is reduced to a negative fatigue point value equal to its normal total, it falls unconscious.
- See through the familiar’s eyes and use its other senses for one combat round, including use of any special detection (night vision, etc.) that the familiar possesses. This costs 1 power point to activate per full turn (5 minutes) and can be spent as needed.
- Use their own INT or POW instead of the familiar’s to defend the familiar against magical attacks while it is in range. If the familiar is outside the magician’s range, its natural INT or POW are used instead.
- Send telepathic messages or commands to the familiar. It will obey these, even if placing itself in danger or certain death. This costs 1 power point per command
- Speak through the creature’s mouth, if possible. The voice that emerges sounds like the magician’s, but as if imitating the familiar. For example, a cat emits a voice like the familiar’s magician owner speaking in a mewling ‘catlike’ voice. This requires the magician to make a successful Idea roll to successfully convey the information through their familiar in this manner—failure means that the familiar is unable to speak that round or make legible sounds. This ability costs 1 power point per sentence expressed (your gamemaster should determine what constitutes a sentence).

The familiar can freely leave the magician’s range but does not leave the magician if it does so—it has simply passed beyond the range the magician can take advantage of any of the abilities listed above. When the magician wishes, the familiar instinctively returns to their side as quickly as it can.

Familiars sometimes assume recognizable aspects of their owner’s mannerisms and appearance, at your or your gamemaster’s discretion. These can be drawn from **Distinctive Features**, **Personality Traits**, or even the results of major wounds. If a magician can make a _Difficult_ Idea roll while examining a familiar, and if the owner is known to the magician, they can determine to whom the familiar is bound to. **_For example,_** *a magician’s cat familiar has taken on a slight limp, as the magician was injured with a major wound in the same limb that never healed. A rival of the magician, seeing a limping cat, may make a *Difficult* Idea roll. If successful, the second magician recognizes the animal as the first magician’s familiar.*

A magician can only have one familiar active at any one time. If the magician attempts to turn another magician’s familiar into their own, they must perform all of the above preparations, and then defeat the combined total of the original owner’s POW plus the familiar’s POW in a POW vs. POW resistance roll to seize command of the familiar. If successful, the familiar changes owners. The original owner immediately knows that the familiar is lost.

A magician can instantly free a familiar from service but does not regain the POW spent. If a familiar is killed, the magician immediately loses all the benefits of the familiar, takes 1D6 points of sympathetic hit point damage and may lose 1D6 SAN (if sanity is being used). The point of POW spent to bind the familiar is lost. If the familiar dies naturally through old age, the magician regains the spent POW point.

### The Wizard’s Staff

A magician may wish to craft a staff or have one made for them. This can be expensive but serves as a sign of magical prowess. A magician with a staff is referred to as a wizard. It isn’t essential for spellcasting, but it is a useful tool and focus that most magicians aspire to have—a sign of authority, skill, and mastery.

The term ‘staff’ describes a length of wood or some other substance, around two meters long, wielded in one or both hands. A staff may, however, be quite different in size, shape, and appearance. It can be smaller (a wand or scepter), shaped like something else (an amulet, ring, or other jewelry), or can even be a weapon. However, it cannot be a living being. A traditional wizard’s staff is treated as a normal staff, though other forms likely have different attributes. Work with your gamemaster to determine a non-traditional staff’s attributes. The time required to make a staff of any non-wood substance is doubled (see below).

The cost to make a staff is usually prohibitively expensive for all but the most experienced and successful of magicians, and your gamemaster should set the physical price accordingly in their setting (it is the equivalent of buying a new car, as a point of reference). The process of manufacturing a wizard’s staff requires six months, and while it is generally known to most magicians, your gamemaster may require your character to make a successful Research or appropriate Knowledge roll. At your gamemaster’s discretion, the staff may require special elements, such as expensive and rare items or substances. Or it may be composed of cheap and relatively common components. All of this depends on the magician’s personal style.

While the staff is being constructed by the most skilled artisans, your character cannot do any other task because they must oversee each step of the construction process, becoming familiar with every aspect of the staff until it is like an extension of their own mind. The final ritual to be enacted over the staff costs your character a point of permanent POW, subtracted from their total. There is no roll to be made, but the POW point does not regenerate.

The staff acts as a reservoir of power points for your character. It can store power points up to your character’s current POW at the time of the making of the staff (minus the permanent point of POW sacrificed). For example, if your character has POW 17 and makes a wizard’s staff, the staff can store 16 power points at any time (17– 1=16). The wizard chooses when to use the staff’s power points to power a magic spell, but cannot remove power points to replenish their own supply, or move any power points into the staff. The staff is essentially a living being in its own right, and regains spent power points at the same rate as a player character of equivalent POW. However, if reduced to 0 power points it will wither and die: never to store power points again.

Some wizards learn to fight using their staves, while others would never dream of risking these powerful spellcasting tools in such dangerous activity. However, in combat, a wizard’s staff is a powerful weapon. A wizard’s staff has 20 hit points (if it is not a staff, increase its hit point total by 5) and does damage as a normal staff (see _Chapter 8: Equipment_, or below, for more details). If it strikes a target successfully, it will do an additional 1D6 points of damage if its current power point total successfully overcomes the target’s current power points in a resistance roll. This extra damage costs 1 power point whenever this ability is used, though the point is subtracted after the resistance roll. This is not an automatic feature, and must be specified by the wizard, but does not require any action or take any additional time to activate. If the staff is broken in combat, it becomes useless and dies, so to speak, and cannot be used for storing power points again.

A staff can be enchanted with magic spells such as Countermagic and Protection if the magician wishes, though at your gamemaster’s discretion, it will not allow other powers (psychic abilities, sorcery, etc.) to affect it. A wizard must be in physical contact with their staff in order to use it.

A wizard can own and use any number of staves, and will sometimes disguise them cleverly, to avoid announcing their true function to enemies or even allies.

|Weapon|Skill|Base|Dmg|Attk|Special|Rng|Hands|HP|Parry|STR/DEX|Mal|Value|SIZ/Enc|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Quarterstaff|Staff|25|1D8+dm+1D6*|1|Crushing|All|2H|20|Yes|9/9|—|Cheap|1.5|

*On a successful strike, roll the staff’s power points vs. the target’s power points. If successful, it does an extra 1D6 damage, at the cost of 1 power point from the wielder.

### Gaining POW

A magician must have a high POW, as they spend power points for spells and POW helps with spell resistance rolls. Fortunately, a magician can increase their POW in several ways.

Any time a magician overcomes the magical resistance of a target of equal or greater POW, their POW has been exercised successfully and may increase. This includes situations when the magician’s defensive (passive) POW resists an attacker’s (active) POW if that POW was higher than their POW. Overcoming or resisting a target of lower POW does not provide a chance for improvement. Only POW resistance rolls qualify, not those opposing power points vs. power points.

When successful in a POW resistance roll against an equal or higher POW, place an experience check next to the POW characteristic. When checking for experience, the magician’s POW may increase (see **POW Increases**). Each successful improvement improves POW by 1D3–1 points. As with other experience checks, this only applies once per adventure, not for each spell resisted.

### Gaining New Spells

A magician can get new spells by seeking them out, discovering them, and buying or otherwise attaining physical copies of other grimoires, scrolls, etc., then transferring the spell into their own grimoire. Alternately, a magician can take one game month per spell to study the principles of any desired spell, assuming they have some sort of references. At the end of this month, a successful roll of INT+POW means that the spell is learned and in the magician’s grimoire. It begins at a rating of INT×1.

If a magician is trying to invent a new spell, discuss it with your gamemaster. The magician must then spend six months researching it, attempting a roll of INT+POW each month. Failure adds another month to the overall time. In all, after six successful rolls, the spell is known at a skill rating of INT×1.

### Use of Spells by Non-magicians

Non-magicians (those without formal training) may be able to learn and cast spells. They do not know how to create or read a grimoire, does not know how to ready or dismiss spells, and simply knows the spell(s) they were taught. A non-magician can know up to ¼ their INT (rounded down) in spell levels. These spells begin at an INT×1 skill rating and take an amount of time equal to 30 minus the non-magician’s INT in weeks to learn. Non-magicians cannot research or create new spells.

### Becoming a Magician

If a character does not begin play as a magician or lacks access to magic spells and wishes to learn them, they must first find a wizard (a highly-skilled magician) to teach them. The apprenticeship to become a magician is a full-time job, and takes an amount of time equal to 30 minus the character’s INT in months of uninterrupted study, during which time they learn their initial roster of spells, prepares a grimoire, and increases the number of magic spells they can hold in INT from ¼ INT (the limit for a non-magician) to ½ INT. The wizard may charge for their services as described in **Skill Improvement**. At the end of this apprenticeship, the character emerges as a magician, with skill ratings in four spells equal to INT×1, having constructed a grimoire of their own, and possessing knowledge of how to bind a familiar and make a wizard’s staff.

### Magic Spell Success Levels

As each spell uses a roll to determine success or failure, success levels can also measure the quality of the magic spell roll. However, unlike skills, magic spells are not cut-and-dried in how their effects should be applied based on the result of the roll. Many magic spells have effects that are either “on” or “off”, with no difference between a critical, special success, and a normal success. Your gamemaster should consider the spell’s nature and potential effects when deciding these outcomes. Following are guides to success levels and how they might apply to magic spells:

- **Fumble:** All power points intended to be spent on the spell are lost. Additionally, the magician cannot attempt use of this spell for one combat round after the round the spell failed in. If the spell involves doing damage, the magician should make a Luck roll: success indicates that the spell just fizzled and does not work, while failure indicates that the spell struck an unintended target (an innocent bystander, an ally, valuable equipment, etc.) causing collateral damage and potentially complicating the situation.
- **Failure:** The spell doesn’t work but causes no harm or complications. One power point is spent, but the spell has no useful effect.
- **Success:** The spell works as described and the requisite power points are expended.
- **Special:** The spell works with increased effectiveness. If it does damage, the spell does special damage, as if it were an attack (see _Chapter 6: Combat_). If one of the special success damage types (crushing, entangling, impaling, knockback, or slashing) is appropriate, your gamemaster should incorporate it into the spell’s effectiveness.

**_For example,_** _a special success roll for a Lightning spell might cause knockback._

At your gamemaster’s discretion, another aspect of the spell (range, influence, etc.) may enjoy 150% effect. Alternately, if the spell requires a resistance roll, increase the spell’s level by ×1.5.

- **Critical:** The spell works perfectly. If it causes damage, it ignores any armor the target possesses and does the maximum possible damage. If it does not normally cause damage, your gamemaster should determine an appropriate aspect (or aspects) of the spell and double its effectiveness. Alternately, if the spell involves a resistance roll, your gamemaster may temporarily double the power’s level or the relevant characteristic for the resistance roll.

These outcomes may require additional interpretation, or your gamemaster can just use the results of dice rolls without any adjustment for degrees of success. This should be applied fairly and consistently, and the players should be told whether detailed success levels are being used.

### Magic Spells

Following are a variety of basic spells. These are defined in the following manner:

- **Name:** The common name of the spell. You may choose to call it something more flavorful, if desired.
- **Range:** The maximum effective range for any spell is 100 meters unless otherwise specified. If it directly affects a target (living or otherwise), the target must be within line of sight.
- **Duration:** Spells usually occur instantly in the Powers Phase of the combat round they are cast in. They usually last for a single combat round, 10 combat rounds, or for 15 minutes, as indicated in each spell description.
- **Power Point Cost per Level:** The power costs this number of power points to cast per level.

#### Magic Spell Summary

### Blast

**Range:** 100 meters

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 3

Use this spell to attack a single target with a beam of magic energy. The target takes 1D6 damage per level. Under most circumstances, non-magical armor absorbs the damage, and this spell can be dodged. If Blast is parried with a shield, the shield takes the damage, with any remainder going to the target.

Countermagic may stop Blast, but Protection does not work. Resistance does not work against Blast.

### Change

**Range:** 30 meters

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to change a targeted being or object into a variety of shapes from the same relative type (animal to animal, vegetable to vegetable, mineral to mineral, etc.). Each level affects 3 SIZ of the target if the magician can overcome the target’s POW in a resistance roll. If the target is willing (or the magician themself), no resistance roll is required. To target something larger than 3 SIZ, use enough levels to affect the creature or object’s full SIZ. The targeted being is then transformed into a creature or object of that exact SIZ. The new shape has the outward attributes and limitations of the shape (including natural abilities, if any), but characteristics remain unchanged. Whenever applicable, the target’s characteristics and skills are used, or the base rating in a newly acquired skill (such as Fly).

_Chapter 11: Creatures_ describes a variety of sample creatures. Either use the standard writeup or customize one if it is used regularly. If estimating a creature’s capabilities, assume that large claws do 1D6 plus damage modifier, and a bite or horn will do 1D3 plus damage modifier.

If the target has already taken hit point damage before the spell is cast, the new form appears in a similarly wounded state. Similarly, any power points, fatigue, or other conditions existing on the target are not affected, as appropriate.

In addition to the number of SIZ points this spell can affect, additional levels can be used to affect more than one object (for example, casting one spell to affect two or more beings, provided enough SIZ is covered), or extending the duration of the spell by 15 minutes. When the spell is cast, the magician should specify how additional levels of the spell are being used.

### Conjure (type) Elemental

**Range:** 12 meters

**Duration:** 10 combat rounds

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1 per point of elemental POW

This spell conjures or dismisses a specific type of elemental, chosen when the spell is taken. For the duration of the spell, the elemental must be directed by the magician’s full attention. Each point of POW the elemental possesses costs 1 power point.

The following elementals are described in _Chapter 11: Creatures_.

- **Air:** Called sylphs, they usually appear as beautiful, near-transparent humanoids, either naked or clad in diaphanous clothing. They have transparent wings, either feathered or like those of an insect. They usually glide aboveground.
- **Earth:** Called gnomes, they are usually thick-bodied humanoid beings made of earth and rock, frequently male, with mossy beards and roots that cross their bodies like veins.
- **Fire:** Called salamanders, they usually appear as hairless humanoids wreathed in fire, with darkened skin glowing in cracks from within. Alternately, they appear as reptiles or serpents.
- **Water:** Called undines, and often appear as beautiful mermaids, half-fish and half-human, pale green and blue. When they appear on land, their fishtails are replaced with human legs.

Elementals may appear in entirely different forms, and other types may exist.

### Control

**Range:** 100 meters

**Duration:** 10 combat rounds

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 3

Use this spell to control the thoughts and/or actions of one intelligent being. The magician must succeed in a POW vs. POW resistance roll against the target. Each level of the spell allows the magician to control one being. This spell cannot be used on unintelligent animals. Each attack is independent with a POW vs. POW roll made against each target. The magician must concentrate on the spell, using no other spells or doing anything more than moving slowly and speaking briefly, or the target will simply stand idle. The magician must make an Idea roll if distracted,

The magician controls the movements and speech of the target(s). The target cannot speak or perform any voluntary action other than those specified, but if the magician wishes, the target can speak freely or have a limited range of free actions. Having more than one target do different things requires an Idea roll each combat round to maintain coordination between different targets. If the magician is forced to fight or concentrates on any other activity, the target(s) collapses into sleep. Once control is lost, a collapsed target will revive and regain control with a roll of CON×1. The roll may be attempted once each combat round after collapsing.

If the target is commanded to perform an action it would normally find objectionable, a _Difficult_ Idea lets it resist. Success means that the target balks and does not follow the order for one combat round, standing still or otherwise idling. Failure means the target performs the action as required. The action can be commanded again in the following round, with a new Idea roll. If the action commanded is wholly objectionable, such as murder of an ally, the Idea roll is unmodified. If the command is suicidal, the Idea roll is _Easy_. If the result of the Idea roll is a special success, the target breaks free from the Control spell in an obvious fashion. If the result of the Idea roll is a critical success, the target breaks free unbeknownst to the spell’s caster.

When the Control spell is done, the target may make an Idea roll. If successful, they remember every detail of actions taken under the spell’s influence. They do not necessarily remember who the spellcaster was, unless it is obvious.

### Countermagic

**Range:** 100 meters

**Duration:** 5 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to create a magical shield around the magician or any desired subject they wish to keep magic from affecting. Any incoming spell must have its level overcome the level of the Countermagic on the resistance table. If the attacking spell’s resistance roll succeeds, the spell penetrates the Countermagic, but must still overcome the POW of the target, if required. If it does not require a resistance roll, it acts as if no Countermagic spell was cast. If the Countermagic spell succeeds on the resistance table, the incoming spell has rebounded on the original caster. If that caster has Countermagic on themself, the spell must overcome that Countermagic to have an effect. Any spell failing to penetrate two Countermagic spells dissipates and is no more. Countermagic protects the target and anything they are carrying, within reason (if in doubt, use the character’s STR as a guideline as to how much they can carry).

If the character or object to receive the Countermagic already has a Protection spell, the Countermagic is not effective unless its level overcomes the level(s) of Protection on the resistance table. If successful, both spells take effect. Countermagic is effective vs. Blast and Lightning, but not against Fire or Frost.

### Dark

**Range:** 100 meters

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to dampen all light within a circle 3 meters in radius plus 3 meters per level. This darkness is absolute, and light cannot shine through it. The spell must be cast on an object; it does not hang in mid-air. The affected area is in total darkness to anyone seeing in the normal range of visible light, even if a torch or other light source is active within the spell’s radius. Dark can be cast on an object that Light has previously been cast upon. Each level of Dark cancels a single level of Light.

### Diminish

**Range:** Touch

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to overcome the target’s POW with a resistance roll and reduce their STR, CON, SIZ or DEX by –1 per level of the spell. Pick which of the target’s characteristics will be affected before the spell is cast. Subsequent casts can reduce the same characteristic or affect a different characteristic. This spell affects any attributes derived from these characteristics, such as hit points, power points, characteristic rolls, characteristic modifiers, etc. Characteristics cannot be reduced below 1, and points of Diminish more than that have no further effect.

### Dispel

**Range:** 100 meters

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this power to rid oneself (or another target) of detrimental or positive effects of a spell. Like Countermagic, it must overcome the level of the spell on the resistance table. Dispel must be directed at a particular spell in effect on the target. Identify the spell’s effects to be eliminated (if numerous magic effects are in place, the gamemaster decides which are affected). If the target is protected by Countermagic, it must get through the Countermagic to affect the target. If the Dispel is intended to be effective against multiple spells, the spell’s level is rolled against each of them on the resistance table. In the case of multiple targets, the caster must either specify whether the Dispel is intended to work against a single spell or all of them.  
If multiple spells are to be dispelled, the one with the highest levels is checked first against the Dispel power on the resistance table. Any effects that are not dispelled remain, and any failure to Dispel a spell means that the Dispel spell ceases working and cannot be pitted against further spells.

Dispel can also be used against someone as they cast another spell, to prevent the spell from being cast. This is handled in the Statement of Intent phase of combat. With a successful Luck roll, a magician who can act in the round, but has not already done so, can abandon their intended action and attempt to use Dispel against a spell as it is cast. Dispel can be used as a held action. To interrupt a spell from being cast, the magician must cast equal or higher levels in Dispel or the Dispel doesn’t work.

Dispel can also be used to banish or destroy lesser summoned creatures (elementals or minor demons) or a possessor (for example, a being that has seized control over a host’s body using the Control spell). In these cases, the Dispel’s levels are compared against the creature’s own POW characteristic. If the creature’s POW is overcome on the resistance table, it departs as quickly as possible. If it is a possessing being, the creature flees the host body immediately. If multiple appropriate beings are within the range of the spell, you must clarify which one is being targeted, or all of them are targeted, with the highest POW being the one attempted first. If the Dispel succeeds on the first, it then moves to the second, etc. If it fails, it does not have further effect on any remaining beings.

### Dull

**Range:** 100 meters

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to reduce the attack chance of a weapon by –5% and its damage by –1 point. More than one level can either reduce the attack chance more (to –10%, –15%, etc.) or reduce damage by –2, –3, etc., or it can be distributed equally among several weapons up the level of the spell and within range. If a weapon leaves the range, it is no longer affected. Damage cannot be reduced below 1 point, and a roll of 01% always hits, regardless of modifiers.

### Enhance

**Range:** Touch

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to overcome the target’s POW in a resistance roll and add +1 to one of the target’s STR, CON, SIZ or DEX per level of the spell. Pick which of the target’s characteristics will be affected before the spell is cast. Subsequent castings can increase the same characteristic or affect a different characteristic. This will temporarily affect other attributes derived from these characteristics, such as hit points, power points, characteristic rolls, characteristic modifiers, etc. Hit points and power points above the target’s normal range are lost.

### Fire

**Range:** 100 meters

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 3

Use this spell to create a pillar of fire doing 1D6 fire damage to everything in a circle 1 meter in diameter. Multiple levels may be used to set up several fires instead of one large fire or can combine the effects.

A target can attempt to dodge out of the affected area. The spell’s damage is absorbed by armor, Protection, and Resistance spells, but Countermagic has no effect. The spell lasts only one combat round unless cast on or consuming something flammable. If so, the blaze continues, damaging anyone or anything within it at the rate of 1D4 points per combat round (see **Fire and Heat**).

Levels of this spell can be used to cancel levels of Frost on the resistance table, but Fire has no effect against other forms of supernatural cold.

### Frost

**Range:** 100 meters

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 3

Use this spell to create a pillar of intense cold doing 1D6 cold damage per level to everything in a circle 1 meter in diameter. Multiple levels may be used to set up several frosted areas instead of one large one, or can combine the effects.

A target can attempt to dodge out of the affected area. The spell’s damage is absorbed by armor, Protection, and Resistance spells, but Countermagic has no effect. The spell lasts only one combat round unless something brittle is frozen. In this case, the brittle item may shatter (see **Cold and Exposure**).

Levels of this spell can be used to cancel levels of Fire on the resistance table, but Frost has no effect against other forms of supernatural flame.

### Heal

**Range:** Touch

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 3

This spell heals 1D6 hit points of damage per level. Restoring a character to a positive hit point total with Heal can restore them to life if successfully cast by the end of the round following that in which the victim suffered the mortal wound. Any limbs severed or lost through a major wound or use of the hit location system are still severed or lost, though the hit points are still restored. Heal has no effect on disease, poison, or radiation, though it can restore lost hit points caused by them.

### Illusion

**Range:** 30 meters

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to create up to 3 SIZ points per level of an object’s appearance. This is visual only, with no sound, scent, touch, or taste. If touched, it remains but is insubstantial. Illusions can be used to mislead or terrify opponents, or entrap them, disguising walls, concealing traps, etc. The illusion is immobile unless the caster concentrates on the illusion to the exclusion of all else. Those witnessing an illusion may attempt to detect the falsehood in one of several manners, depending on the circumstances:

- If the illusion should have sound, a successful Idea roll reveals it. If the illusion does not need sound, a _Difficult_ Spot roll is required to see through it. If some form of sound accompanies the illusion, a _Difficult_ Listen or Sense roll is required to notice it is not real.
- If the viewer suspects it is an illusion and attempts to disbelieve it, roll the magician’s POW vs. the viewer’s INT on the resistance table.

### Invisibility

**Range:** Touch

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to turn 3 SIZ per level of an object or another being invisible. Items or living beings cannot be turned partially invisible, though components can if the object consists of more than one “piece”.

The magician must concentrate on the spell and must do no more than walk or speak to maintain the invisibility. Fighting, taking injury, using another power, performing some athletic maneuver, or similar distractions break the effects and end the spell. Any attacks against an invisible character or object are at 1/5 the attacker’s skill rating. Any parries are equally difficult, requiring a successful Listen, Sense, or Spot roll to even make the attempt. This power does not stop sound or other sensory clues from the target, and successful use of a Listen, Sense, or Spot skill reduces the penalty of attacks to _Difficult_ instead of 1/5.

An invisible character can move, attack, flee, or stand still while the spell is active. Invisibility can be dispelled by the magician at any time, though starting it again requires another casting.

### Lift

**Range:** 100 meters

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to lift 3 SIZ per level of an object or being and move it through the air. This spell can be cast on oneself, using it to fly. The target of the spell is moved up to 24 meters per combat round. Each level of the spell above the minimum necessary to move the SIZ add +6 meters movement per combat round. No resistance roll is required for weight equal to or below the number of SIZ affected by the spell (for example, casting Lift 4 allows your character to manipulate up to 12 points of SIZ without needing to make a roll on the resistance table). If the target does not wish to be lifted (or is held by or connected to something), the magician must overcome its POW or SIZ with a resistance roll (gamemaster choice).

The spell may also be used to slow a falling object that is otherwise too large for the level of the spell. For each level less than needed, the object is slowed as if it were falling that difference times 3 meters, up to a 12-meter reduction.

The spell may also move an object such as cart or sledge along the ground. In this case, each level of the spell can affect 6 SIZ of the targeted object or character. This spell can also be used to throw an object already lifted, with a _Difficult_ roll of the caster’s Throw skill.

### Light

**Range:** 100 meters

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to illuminate a circle 3 meters per level in radius. This light is around the brightness of a torch or small light bulb. The spell must be cast on an object; it does not hang in mid-air. Light can be cast on an object that has had Dark previdously cast upon it, canceling both spells on a level-for-level basis.

### Lightning

**Range:** 60 meters

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 3

Use this spell to throw a lightning bolt doing 1D6 damage per level directly to the hit points of the desired target (usually a living being). If cast, the spell will hit if not dodged or parried. If two targets are equally close, the Lightning strikes the target wearing or wielding the most metal. Countermagic protects against the spell, and other insulation may protect the character (gamemaster’s discretion). When used on a metallic object, Lightning has a chance equal to the magician’s POW multiplied by its level of traveling (and jumping) along any connected or nearby metallic surface to strike any other characters touching the metal surface for ½ damage. Additionally, it can “fry” any electronic equipment it targets, using the magician’s POW against the item’s hit points in a resistance roll.

A target can dodge or parry Lightning with a shield. Dodging lightning is _Difficult_ if wearing metal armor, and if Lightning is parried successfully with a non-metallic shield, the shield takes the damage, with any remainder carrying over to the target. Parrying Lightning with a metallic shield is useless, as the Lightning conducts through the shield and to the target.

### Perception

**Range:** 60 meters

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to point out the direction of the nearest example of one type of thing (specified by the caster when the spell is cast), such as the nearest trap, secret door, gold, magic, stairway, unfamiliar thoughts, etc. within range. Additional levels let the caster seek out more than one thing at the same time. The gamemaster can determine if similar things are close enough to count.

**_For example,_** _Perception 2 can find the closest two traps, or it may find the closest trap and the closest secret door._

### Protection

**Range:** 100 meters

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to add +1 point per level to the target’s armor points (even if no armor is worn). Any Countermagic cast upon on the target must overcome the Protection spell on the resistance table. If successful, both spells remain on the target and in effect. At your gamemaster’s discretion, this spell can also provide protection against damage types not normally blocked by armor.

### Resistance

**Range:** Touch

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to gain 1 point of resistance per level against damage taken from extremes of temperature or the environment, such as Fire or Frost spells. If the protected character is hit by more than one such attack, each damage roll is reduced by the level of the effect.

#### Protection and Resistance

Protection and Resistance apparently serve the same purpose: keeping your character from taking damage, but they do differ.

- **Protection** is like armor and is subtracted from any physical damage taken, but it is not effective against environmental extremes.
- **Resistance** lowers the amount of damage taken by environmental extremes (heat, cold), but is not effective against attacks or physical damage.

Some attacks, such as a flaming sword or a falling flaming roof beam, may be affected by both spells at once, with Protection reducing the points of damage from the blade itself, and Resistance reducing the extra damage from the flames.

### Seal

**Range:** Touch

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to bond the edges of any two inanimate objects which are at rest and fitted to one another, such as a door in a door frame, a lid on a box, or a knife in a sheath. The two objects become joined as if they were one object and cannot be separated while the spell is in effect. The objects can be battered open or destroyed, their hit points and other values combined, when applicable. Seal adds +20 hit points to the combined hit point total of the two items.

Each level adds either 15 minutes to the duration of the spell or adds +20 additional hit points to the hit points of the sealed objects. The caster may split levels between these two benefits, deciding how before casting the spell.

### Sharpen

**Range:** 100 meters

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to add +5% to the attack chance and +1 damage to any weapon (including blunt weapons and missile weapons) it is successfully applied to, up to the maximum damage possible using that weapon. Additional levels can either add multiples of +5% and +1 point of damage to the weapon (+10% and +2 damage, +15% and +3 damage, etc.), or can be distributed equally among several weapons, up to the level of the spell and within range.

**_For example,_** _Sharpen 6 can be used to add +5% and +1 damage to all six bullets in a revolver._

The damage bonus is only applied to the weapon’s natural range of damage, with the user’s damage modifier (if applicable) applied separately, unmodified by the spell.

### Speak to Mind

**Range:** 100 meters

**Duration:** 10 combat rounds

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to speak to one other mind per level, whether intelligent or not. Only surface conversation or feelings are transmitted, and the target may need to make an Idea roll to understand if not traditionally intelligent. Language is not a barrier to this spell, however. Multiple targets of the spell cannot communicate to each other using this spell, though casting Speak to Mind 1 on a target, lets them communicate with one other mind.

### Teleport

**Range:** 1,000 meters

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use Teleport to instantaneously teleport 3 SIZ per level from its current location to another place within range. Only complete objects can be teleported—it is impossible to teleport a part of a living being away. If an object is not directly affixed to another object, it can be teleported.

**_For example,_** _a gun can be teleported out of a target’s holster, but not the engine block out of a car._

Additional levels above the target’s SIZ can be used to increase the range by an additional +1,000 meters. If the target of the spell is affixed to something or is a living being that does not wish to be transported, the caster must overcome the item’s hit points (or armor value) vs. their POW on the resistance table. For a living target, the target’s POW is the opposing force. A willing target (such as oneself) does not require a resistance roll.

A fumble may send the item or person being teleported into a solid object, perhaps even underground. The caster should attempt a Luck roll if a fumble has been rolled. If the Luck roll is successful, no damage or ill effects are taken, and the teleported character or object narrowly escapes a grim fate. If the roll fails, the unlucky target immediately takes 3D6 points of damage and suffers an injury from the **Major Wound Table**, modified as appropriate.

Attempting to Teleport a foe or item into a solid structure allows the target the same chances as described above (a Luck roll). It costs 3 power points per level to consciously teleport something or someone into a solid structure or object (plus a 0/1D3 Sanity roll). If the subject of the teleportation into a solid substance is another item, your gamemaster decides what happens. A living being becoming fused with a solid item is usually traumatic, and the target must find some means of extricating themselves from the item or structure (such as another Teleport spell). Failure to do so can cause any Major Wound (as above) to have permanent effect.

### Unseal

**Range:** Touch

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to open unlocked doors or boxes and cause weapons to fly out of their sheaths and drop to the ground. It will not undo a locked container, or some object that has been fastened shut. It can be cast to cancel Seal if the level of Unseal overcomes the level of Seal on the resistance table.

### Vision

**Range:** 100/10 meters

**Duration:** 10 combat rounds

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to see what is happening in any area within 100 meters of a familiar area, or within 10 meters of an unfamiliar area. This gives full vision and hearing, as if in that area, allowing that point of view to have any mobility they possess, while within the spell’s range. A caster physically near an area within the 10-meter range can cast it into that area, regardless of familiarity.

Each additional level allows viewing of a place or events that have transpired for up to +1 additional day. When viewing an area, the caster’s perception of time is unaltered—10 combat rounds of the spell take 10 combat rounds to view—but can be ended at any time by the caster.

This spell may also be used to touch an item and receive a vision of its previous user or owner. Each additional level used gives another use or another mental image. When casting, designate how to allocate extra levels. Furthermore, each level of this spell allows a cumulative 10% chance of learning the activating word for a magical device. This spell can only be attempted once for any single object until the spell’s skill ranking is increased by at least +5%.

While using the Vision spell, the caster may not use any other spell or the Vision spell’s effects end.

### Wall

**Range:** 12 meters

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 1

Use this spell to form a wall-like barrier out of the ground, formed from one particular type of available material that would normally be able to be sculpted into such a wall, such as earth, snow, ice, stone, metal, wood, concrete, gravel, sand, etc. The wall usually appears immediately before the caster to protect them against attacks or attackers, though it can appear anywhere within range. When created, the barrier is 1 square meter per level of the spell. These square meters can be distributed as desired along the dimensions of width, height, and length.

**_For example,_** _casting Wall 9 and spending 9 power points lets the caster create a wall 3 meters high, 1 meter thick, and 3 meters long or 1 meter high, 1 meter thick, and 9 meters long._

This wall can be shaped in whatever simple form desired, such as a straight or curved wall, a half-sphere, etc.

Regardless of the substance it is made of, a Wall has 30 hit points. Each additional level above and beyond those defining its size adds +30 hit points to its hit point total, though an attacker generally only needs to destroy one or two 1-meter segments to create adequate space to move through it. At the end of the spell’s duration, the Wall dissolves, crumbles, melts, retracts into the earth, or gradually disappears, as appropriate.

If desired, the Wall’s 30 hit point value can be based on the guidelines in the **Armor Values of Substances** and O**bject SIZ Examples** tables.

### Ward

**Range:** Touch

**Duration:** Permanent

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 3

Use Ward to form a protective square of up to nine square meters around the person or object needing guarding or protection. The Ward is defined by four objects (called the wards) enchanted in a preliminary ritual to gain the effect. These wards do not gain any magical enhancement other than being attuned to one another for the purpose of the spell. Ward acts as a combination of Countermagic and Blast. Any power points passing through the region defined by Ward (in either direction) must overcome Countermagic 1. Any object crossing the line from either direction receives Blast 1. Each extra level adds +3 meters to any dimension of the area defined by the ward, or another level of Countermagic and Blast. The spell must be successfully cast to set up the wards and successfully cast again to take them down without harming the caster. The spell’s effects last until the wards are moved by the original caster, or destroyed, or the spell is dispelled.

Only the caster may move the ward objects without disturbing the spell. However, Dispel may be cast upon them. Physically interfering with the objects sets off the Countermagic and Blast capabilities, as if the Ward was triggered. If some other means of manipulating the objects is attempted, each ward has 30 hit points and acts as if it had Seal cast upon it.

### Wounding

**Range:** Touch

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Power Point Cost per Level:** 3

Use this spell to cause 1D6 points of magic damage per level directly to the target. Wounding requires a successful Brawl roll to touch the target in combat, or an Agility roll if not in combat. Either roll becomes _Easy_ if the target is unsuspecting. Armor does not protect against this damage, though any Protection subtracts from the spell’s damage. The Brawl attack does not do any damage, regardless of what powers or weapons are being used, and it may be parried, dodged, or blocked as per a normal Brawl attack.

## Mutations

Mutations occur through exposure to radioactivity, chemical exposure, medical experimentation, strange environmental conditions, genetic quirks, or other means. They can appear at birth, manifest later, or develop otherwise. Characters with mutations are usually called **mutants**. Some animals may have mutations (see _Chapter 11: Creatures_).

Some mutations are disadvantages, causing unfortunate and unwelcome conditions. These negative qualities are called **adverse mutations**, while positive ones are **beneficial mutations**. In some methods of character generation, mutations are randomly assigned, and are not chosen by the player.

Few mutations act like skills, though they are often assigned a potency (POT) rating to allow for resistance rolls and comparison of intensity. Mutations do not have levels, but some are defined as either **minor** or **major**, less intense or more powerful versions.

### Starting Mutations

When determining your character’s starting mutations, a major mutation is the equivalent of two minor mutations and two minor mutations are worth one major mutation. Each mutation begins as a minor mutation, and if you pick or randomly roll the same result twice, it becomes a major mutation. Each mutation’s description defines the minor and major versions. All references to CON are for your character’s initial CON, before the effects of any mutations are applied. Following are the suggested number of mutations by power level:

- **Normal:** Your gamemaster may allow you to pick instead of rolling, but otherwise roll D100 twice on the **Random Mutations Table**. Each mutation is minor, but if you get the same result twice it is major. Make a Luck roll if the mutation is adverse. If successful, roll again for another mutation. If the mutation rolled is adverse once more, repeat the process until you either fail a Luck roll or gain a beneficial mutation.
- **Heroic:** Choose mutations equal to ¼ your character’s CON (round up), with a minimum of 2. Major mutations count as two picks, and you can pick two major mutations only if your gamemaster allows it. You can take adverse mutations to increase the number of beneficial choices at a rate of 1 to 1 (picking one minor adverse mutation lets you pick one minor beneficial mutation, two minor adverse mutations equal a major beneficial mutation, etc.). Your gamemaster must approve taking more than four adverse mutations, and you cannot take more adverse mutations than ¼ your CON.
- **Epic:** Pick minor mutations (or pick a mutation twice) up to ½ your character’s CON (round up) as you see fit. Guidance for taking adverse mutations is as above, limited to ½ CON (round up).
- **Superhuman:** Pick mutations equal to CON, with a limit of up to ½ CON (round up) in adverse mutations. Major mutations are highly recommended. Your gamemaster may allow you to take a mutation at above major quality (for three picks) and work with you to determine its effects if they are not obvious.

### Gaining New Mutations

Mutations, unlike skills or magic powers, are not learned or gained through adventuring. However, mutation is change, and a world with mutations is full of ways to promote that. Here are some of the ways mutations may appear or evolve in play:

- **Mutagenic Exposure:** Prolonged or deliberate exposure to a mutagen, a substance or condition that can cause or increase mutation. Usually scientific in nature (chemicals, radiation, etc.) it could be through magic. Your gamemaster should determine if this causes a minor mutation, then pick or roll on the **Random Mutations Table**. This is usually a minor mutation, though mutation(s) can be major.
- **Evolution:** An existing adverse mutation, once exposed to a mutagen, may increase or decrease. Increase an already-existing mutation from minor to major, or vice versa. An adverse minor mutation can be eliminated entirely. This is only one step, but under the right circumstances, a major adverse mutation may become no mutation.
- **Transformation:** Some mutations become absolute and total transformations. In a “perfect storm” of mutagenic conditions, the mutant may enter a chrysalis state (a cocoon or equivalent) and emerge with all mutations transformed into other mutations. Your gamemaster must approve this, and it should take time (the mutant’s CON in days, for example). In this time, the mutant can switch any mutations for new ones, as if in character creation.
- **Increase in CON:** An increase in CON (see **Increasing Characteristics**) increases mutation potential: for each point of CON increased, pick or randomly determine a new minor mutation, upgrade a mutation, or downgrade an existing mutation by one level. A decrease in CON does not require loss of mutations.

### Mutations

Following is a list of standard mutations. Those labeled (**Adverse**) are disadvantageous, and those labeled (**Minor**) have only minor versions.

#### Random Mutations Table

Roll D100 to determine mutations (or pick, at the gamemaster’s discretion). Adverse conditions are marked with an asterisk*.

|Result|Mutation|Description|
|---|---|---|
|01–03|Adaptability|Survival in unusual environments.|
|04–05|Allergy|Skills reduced by contact to an allergen.|
|06–09|Biped (Quadruped)*|If two-legged, forced to walk four-legged.|
|10–12|Camouflage|Skin has a concealing texture or color.|
|13–15|Coloration|Unusual coloration (minor only).|
|16–19|Congenital Disease*|Suffers from a debilitating disease.|
|20–22|Decreased Characteristic*|Characteristic decreased.|
|23–25|Disease Carrier*|Carries (but is immune to) an infectious disease.|
|26–29|Group Intelligence|Part of a hive mind.|
|30|Hands|Has extra hands or prehensile limb.|
|31–33|Hardy|Resistant to damage.|
|34–35|Hybrid|Has an animalistic trait.|
|36–37|Imitation|Imitates an animal’s natural trait.|
|38–44|Increased Characteristic|Characteristic increased.|
|45–48|Keen Sense|Has one or more sharp senses.|
|49–50|Luminescence|Emits a light from body.|
|51–53|Metabolic Improvement|Has a beneficial but unusual metabolism.|
|54–57|Metabolic Weakness*|Has a disadvantageous and unusual metabolism.|
|58–60|Natural Armor|Has natural armor (scales, horn, hide, etc.).|
|61–65|Natural Weaponry|Has natural weapon (spine, claw, teeth, etc.).|
|66–67|Pain Sensitivity*|Low resistance to pain.|
|68|Pheromone|Emits chemicals that can affect others.|
|69–70|Reduced Sense*|Impaired or missing primary sense.|
|71–72|Regeneration|Able to heal rapidly.|
|73–74|Sensitivity|Has an unusual affinity for a substance.|
|75–76|Speech (Mimicry)|Can imitate animal noises or speak clearly.|
|77–81|Structural Improvement|Has an unusual and beneficial body form.|
|82–86|Structural Weakness*|Has an unusual and disadvantageous body form.|
|87–89|Venom|Emits a natural poison.|
|90|Wings|Has wings and can glide or fly.|
|91–00|Gamemaster or Player Choice|Pick or roll again.|

### Adaptability

Use this to instantly adjust to a particular extreme condition, chosen when this mutation is selected. Alternately, the mutant can survive the specific condition but does not actually adapt to it (essentially ignoring it). Minor mutations are immunity to radiation, can breathe both air and water, can digest metal and/or stone, etc. Major mutations include immunity to extreme heat, cold, or radiation; survival in a vacuum; etc. In a resistance roll against the condition, the relevant characteristic is doubled.

### Allergy

(**Adverse**) This causes hypersensitivity to a particular substance, plant, or animal of a type picked during character creation. Contact with this substance causes an unpleasant and extreme reaction (nausea, weakness, blindness, etc.). For a minor mutation, subtract –20% from all skill ratings while in contact with the allergen, and for 15 minutes afterwards. For a major mutation, suffer 1D6 hit points damage when exposed to the allergen once per 15 minutes. Armor does not protect against it, and all skill ratings are at –40% while exposed and for 15 minutes after.

### Biped (Quadruped)

(**Adverse**) Your character’s musculature or skeletal structure requires a quadrupedal (four-legged) stance rather than a bipedal (two-legged) one. The minor version allows standing upright for brief periods (equal to CON in combat rounds), before reverting to a four-legged stance. With the major mutation, a successful Agility roll is required for each combat round upright. Other characteristics and attributes are unaffected, as is the ability to use some types of equipment, unless affected by the mutation (gamemaster discretion).

A being normally quadrupedal with this mutation has the musculature and skeletal structure to walk upright, whether all the time or occasionally dropping to quadrupedal stance. For inappropriate creatures (for example, fish or snakes), use Structural Improvement or Structural Weakness instead.

### Camouflage

Use this unnatural coloration, exterior form, or ability to change color to hide from enemies or imitate an object or other type of being. The minor mutation represents alternate coloration or an unusual skin texture, and the major version allows changing color and/or skin texture to match the environment, like a chameleon.

**_For example,_** _a hairless mutant with stony skin could curl up and resemble a rock or might have bark-like skin and imitate a tree._

The minor version of this mutation provides +20% to Hide, and +40% for the major version.

### Coloration

(**Minor**) The mutant’s skin is an unnatural color or colors, often strikingly so. It may glisten like gold, be tiger-striped, or be one solid color. If normally covered with scales, carapace, fur, hair, or some other substance, that has an unusual and unnatural color.

### Congenital Disease

(**Adverse**) The mutant suffers from an incurable and possibly painful non-contagious ailment. It may have hemophilia, deformed bones, cancer, or diminished lung capacity. Such mutants usually have shortened lifespans. As a minor mutation, one characteristic (usually CON) is reduced by 1D6 points. As a major mutation, two characteristics (usually CON and another of your choice) are reduced by 1D6 points. Any modifiers or derived attributes using those characteristics are similarly modified.

### Decreased Characteristic

(**Adverse**) For a minor mutation, first determine which characteristic is decreased through mutation. Roll a D10 and refer to the following chart:

#### Characteristic Change Table

|Result|Attribute|
|---|---|
|1|STR|
|2|CON|
|3|SIZ|
|4|INT|
|5|POW|
|6|DEX|
|7|CHA|
|8|Both STR and SIZ.|
|9|Roll twice, using a D8 instead of a D10.|
|0|Roll three times, using a D8 instead of a D10.|

Roll a D6 to determine how much the characteristic is altered by:

|Result|Reduction|
|---|---|
|1–3|–1D6|
|4–5|–2D6|
|6|–3D6|

No characteristic can be reduced to less than 1, so ignore any reduction beyond 1. For a major mutation, the characteristic reduction is doubled. Any bonuses or derived attributes using those characteristics are similarly modified.

### Disease Carrier

(**Adverse**) The mutant carries a disease with a potency (POT) of 2D10 but is immune to it. The disease may be promulgated by touch or another mode of transmission (proximity, breath, saliva, blood, etc.), with a range of CON if not touch. Anyone exposed must make a resistance roll of their CON vs. the disease’s POT or contracts the disease. As a major mutation, the POT is 4D10, or is two separate diseases, each with its own POT and vector of transmission. See **Disease**.

### Group Intelligence

This power is rare for humans and picked only with your gamemaster’s approval. A mutant with this mutation is either the dominant member of a group of similar linked creatures, or the group itself. Creatures with group intelligence often live in colonies and share the same mind. The experience of one of the group’s creatures is simultaneously experienced by the other members of its colony. At the minor version, the group intelligence is short distance (CON in meters) and is limited to vague sensations or behavioral imperatives. The major version allows for a strong link (telepathic in nature) allowing full communication over an unlimited distance. Often, species with Group Intelligence dwell together and have particular castes specialized for individual roles.

### Hands

The minor version of this mutation provides monkey-like feet; prehensile lips, tongue, or a snout; or a long prehensile tail. The major version provides two such groupings of limbs (prehensile feet and a tail), or an extra set of such organs (two tails, two extra arms, long antennae, etc.). Determine if this allows additional actions in a combat round (see **Two Weapons**). If using hit locations, the new limb(s) are equivalent to an arm or leg, as appropriate.

### Hardy

This mutation allows the mutant to withstand considerable damage before falling unconscious. As a minor mutation, it reduces damage from a particular type of injury (choose something like fire, falling, cutting weapons, etc.) to half rolled damage (round down). As a major mutation, in addition to the resistance to a particular type of damage, the mutant can be reduced to 0 or negative hit points and remains able to act unhindered, until they reach negative hit points equal to their CON. Beyond that, the mutant dies unless healed in the next five minutes to 1 or more hit points.

### Hybrid

Such a mutant is a generic hybrid with the traits of two or more different types of animals. They might have lobster-like claws, a tiger head, or anything else imaginable. As a minor mutation, the mutant has a few defining elements clearly marking them as a hybrid, and as a major mutation, they are more animal than human, and may find it impossible to blend in amongst humans. Generally, characteristics and skills are relatively unaffected, though such a mutant may have claws (1D6 slashing damage), a pointed beak or teeth (1D4 impaling damage). At your gamemaster’s discretion, the major version of this mutation includes the Natural Weaponry minor mutation (below) at no cost to CON. This can be improved to a major mutation normally.

#### Imitation

The mutant can imitate a natural trait of an animal species such as web-spinning, wall-crawling, leaping, egg-laying, amphibiousness, etc. (unless the ability is better covered by another mutation). Describe it like a specialty, such as ‘Imitation (Amphibious)’. The minor version confers the ability to imitate the trait with a successful Luck roll, or the trait adds +20% as bonus to a relevant skill (or skills). As a major mutation, the mutant is not merely imitating the trait but possesses it, as well as any biological or anatomical structures required to use it. Any relevant skills receive a temporary bonus of +40%, and the applicable characteristic is based directly off the mutant’s CON where appropriate.

### Increased Characteristic

Use the **Characteristic Change Table** but the results are positive rather than negative. For a minor mutation, use the results from the chart; for a major mutation, the characteristic increases are doubled. Any bonuses or derived attributes using those characteristics are similarly modified.

### Keen Sense

One primary sense (choose) is heightened, raising any corresponding skills by +20% for a minor mutation and +40% for a major mutation (see below). This mutation may have a physical aspect such as enlarged or unusually shaped sensory organs (eyes, ears, nose, etc.). If using **Distinctive Features**, any visible mutation should be described. Following are the senses affected:

- **Hearing:** The minor version doubles the effective range of the Listen skill, and the major version quadruples it. Normal hearing range is 15 meters, assuming no obstacles or interference. Add +20% to Listen for a minor mutation and +40% if major.
- **Smell/Taste:** The Sense skill can detect the taste or scent of something a normal human is unable to, such as a tasteless poison. Add +20% to Sense for a minor mutation and +40% if major.
- **Touch:** The Sense skill can detect subtle changes in texture through fingertips or other body parts. The major version allows “sight” with exposed skin, letting the mutant act in darkness as if in normal daylight, ignoring any penalties from darkness with a successful Sense skill roll. Add +20% to Sense for a minor mutation and +40% if major.
- **Vision:** The minor version doubles the effective range of the Spot skill, and the major version quadruples it. It also increases the distance at which the mutant can perform skills at, allowing them to Appraise or Search at any distance within sight. Add +20% to Spot for a minor mutation and +40% if major.

This mutation comes with heightened (harmful) sensitivity of the relevant sense. If the mutation is minor, your character must make an Idea roll to avoid being stunned for a round if exposed to an intense form of the sensation (headlights shone on a mutant with keen vision, for example). If the mutation is major, the Idea roll is _Difficult_.

### Luminescence

The mutant can generate a type of light from their body, either faintly glowing or in the form of a beam of light from their eyes or some other body part. The major version permits the mutant to emit a harsh beam of light, able to temporarily blind an opponent if it is shone into their eyes with a successful Agility roll: the target can Dodge to avoid the light. The light’s color, intensity, and any ability to control or alter the light are determined when the mutation is determined. It cannot be overly complex, though potentially could be something like a wisp or ghostlike image. Anything more sophisticated than a small ball of light requires an Idea roll per combat round to manifest and control properly.

### Metabolic Improvement

The mutant has an unusual but advantageous metabolic condition, developed and defined with your gamemaster’s approval. It can be a greatly extended lifespan, unusual sleep habits (needs little sleep), a minimal or unusual appetite, abnormal growth (perhaps your character is only a few years old, but has grown at an accelerated rate), altered perceptions, the ability to hibernate, or something else. The minor mutation provides an unusual but not significant advantage, while the major version of this mutation is a tremendous asset.

### Metabolic Weakness

(**Adverse**) As with Metabolic Improvement, this represents an unusual metabolic condition, ranging from inconvenient to debilitating, developed with your gamemaster’s approval. It could be a shortened lifespan, unusual sleep habits (needs a lot more sleep), a ravenous or unusual appetite (difficult to find foodstuffs), or abnormal growth (perhaps shrinking instead of growing, or aging backwards). The minor version is an inconvenience while the major version is a serious hindrance.

### Natural Armor

The mutant has an unnaturally tough hide, scales, shell, carapace, or some hardened skin giving protection. The minor mutation offers 3-point armor, and the major version is 6-point armor. Any armor worn is added onto this, though the major mutation requires armor to be very loose or customized. The minor version of the mutation can be disguised, while the major version cannot be easily concealed. If random armor values are being used, use 1D3 for the minor mutation, and 1D3+3 for the major mutation. This natural armor primarily protects against physical damage, though it may also work against additional forms of damage, as determined by the gamemaster.

### Natural Weaponry

The mutant has a type of natural weaponry (claws, teeth, spines, horns, etc.). As minor mutation adds +1D6 damage to Brawl damage. If it is a projectile weapon (spines, projecting acid, etc.) it does 1D6 damage with range equal to the mutant’s DEX in meters. As a major mutation, the damage is +2D6 (2D6 for projectiles, and range is doubled). You and your gamemaster should determine whether it’s concealable. Use an equivalent weapon from _Chapter 8: Equipment_ for special success type, length, armor points, etc. The weapon’s hit points (for parrying purposes) are considered to be their own, with no additional hit points added.

The mutant can parry with their natural weapon(s), if appropriate, using the Brawl skill. Damage bonuses usually apply. If the natural weapon is used in missile combat, use Throw or Projection to launch it, or a new specialization of the Missile Weapon skill. At your gamemaster’s discretion, the benefits from this mutation stack with any conferred with the Martial Arts skill.

### Pain Sensitivity

(**Adverse**) Regardless of their CON characteristic, this mutation gives the mutant a very low tolerance for pain. The minor mutation requires a successful Stamina roll to avoid being blinded with agony as if stunned whenever impacted significantly. When taking damage, make a resistance roll of the amount of damage vs. their CON. If the roll fails, the mutant is knocked unconscious for 1D6 combat rounds or until woken up. The major mutation includes that weakness and makes the mutant particularly susceptible to a particular form of attack. Choose a type of damage (fire, edged weapons, gunfire, cold, etc.) that they are particularly vulnerable to. Whenever they take damage from that source, the damage (after armor) is doubled.

### Pheromone

The mutant produces complex pheromones that affect the emotions or behavior of other beings. These chemicals may have a distinctive odor or none at all. The effect might be rage, fear, sorrow, nausea, lust, etc. As a minor mutation, these pheromones elicit one type of emotional or behavioral response (your choice), with a potency (POT) of 2D6 (rolled each time the mutation is used). The targeted creature or creatures must succeed on a resistance roll of their INT vs. the POT of the pheromone or succumb to its effect. The greater mutation allows the choice of which emotion or behavior is to be evoked each full turn (5 minutes). The greater mutation has an increased potency (POT) of 4D6. In either case, the range is the mutant’s CON in meters. If personality traits or passions are being used, add +20% (minor) or +40% to a relevant trait if the mutation is successful.

### Reduced Sense

(**Adverse**) This mutation reduces or eliminates one or more senses, affecting any skills linked to those senses. For the minor mutation, pick one sense. See **Keen Sense** (prior) for skills linked to each sense. The minor mutation impairs the sense considerably, but it still functions. Any uses of the skill are _Difficult_. The major mutation removes the sense entirely. Skills linked to that sense are at 0% and cannot be improved unless the mutation is removed. Other senses (and skills) must accommodate and overcome this mutation.

### Regeneration

The mutant heals rapidly, regaining 1 hit point every minute at the minor version, or 1 hit point each combat round in the powers phase for the major mutation. Regeneration cannot bring the mutant back from the dead but heals damage that would normally require hospitalization. Regeneration also heals the effects of any major wound, though the effects only take place once all hit points from the injury have been restored. When this mutation is picked, determine one type of injury (fire, acid, drowning, etc.) the mutant cannot heal from.

### Sensitivity

The mutant is attuned to a certain item or substance—animal, vegetable, mineral, energy type, etc.—which it can detect automatically at a distance. This must be natural to the game setting (it can’t be “magic” in a no-magic setting), and it doesn’t work on a specific form of object or being.

**_For example,_** _it could be silver, but not silver coins._

The minor mutation detects the substance within CON in meters, and the major mutation the range is CON in miles. If more than one example of the substance is in range, make an Idea roll to distinguish aspects such as the intensity/amount/size and its relative distance. If looking for a very specific example, the Idea roll becomes _Difficult_.

### Speech (Mimicry)

This mutation grants the ability to communicate verbally. It may be low-grade telepathy, or a simple facility for language learning. The mutant may be able to speak animal languages or might have a knack for human languages. Alternately, they can imitate sounds with great accuracy, including voices, machinery, vehicles, explosions, etc. The minor mutation allows imitation of any animal noise; gains a +20% to any Speak Language attempts; and can use vocal mimicry to add a +20% bonus to Disguise attempts. Additionally, the mutant has a starting value of INT×2 (plus skill category bonus) in one animal ‘language’. As a major mutation, add +40 to Speak Language and Disguise attempts, and the mutant can imitate a wide variety of mechanical and environmental sounds with facility. They also speak two animal ‘languages’ at INT×2 (plus skill category bonus), and can imitate any other language at INT×1 starting skill, assuming they can spend an hour or so in close proximity with someone speaking that language. Your gamemaster should determine what animals have a rudimentary ‘language’ (dolphins, whales, chimpanzees, etc.) and if there is any overlap.

### Structural Improvement

The mutant has an advantageous evolution in their skeletal structure, whether an exoskeleton (potentially adding to their natural armor), extra legs or heads, larger or smaller body parts, or new parts such as wings, horns, or spines. Work with your gamemaster to determine the nature of the mutation and its effects. For the minor version, add 2D6 to one affected characteristic, or trade those points to armor points or MOV points on a 1 for 1 basis. POW cannot be altered by this mutation. A successful Disguise roll is required to conceal this mutation. For the major mutation, roll 4D6 and distribute the points as desired (excluding POW). The major mutation is impossible to conceal, and the mutant may have difficulty finding clothing, armor, or worn equipment.

### Structural Weakness

(**Adverse**) This mutation causes a genetic abnormality in the skeletal structure, inconvenient and hindering normal life, whether malformed, disproportioned, or even have additional appendages such as ten extra legs that slow movement. Work with your gamemaster to determine the nature of the mutation and its effects. For the minor version of this mutation, subtract 2D6 from one affected characteristic, or use these points to lower MOV on a 1 for 1 basis. POW cannot be reduced. A successful Disguise roll is required to conceal this mutation. For the major mutation, subtract 4D6 points from STR, DEX, CON, SIZ, or CHA, dividing points as desired. No characteristic can be reduced to below 1. The major mutation is impossible to conceal, and the mutant may have difficulty finding clothing, armor, or worn equipment.

### Venom

The mutant manufactures a type of venom within their body and can inject it with sting, bite, spine, or claw, or it may coat their body. Alternately, it might be a gas they exude, projected spittle, or might take effect only if the mutant is bitten. If projected, make a successful Throw or Projection skill roll; if it is dealt hand-to-hand, use Brawl. The minor mutation has potency (POT) 2D6 (roll each time the mutation is used), and the major mutation has POT 4D6. This poison may cause paralysis, sleep, attribute reduction, blindness, or another effect (gamemaster’s approval). A resistance roll determines if the poison has any effect (see **Poisons**). A ranged venom attack has a range equal to CON in meters.

### Wings

This mutation provides functional wings—batlike, birdlike, insectile, etc.—or even a gaseous internal organ that makes the mutant bulbous and lighter than air. With the minor mutation, flight is equal to MOV in meters per combat round, or any slower speed, including hovering. With the major mutation, the speed is MOV×2. Carry anything else while flying depends upon STR, with a maximum of STR in SIZ (or ENC) carried. The mutant has a starting Fly skill at DEX×2 (plus skill category modifier, if used) for the minor mutation, and DEX×4 for major (plus skill category modifier, if used).

## Psychic Abilities

These strange powers allow their users to see into the thoughts of others, manipulate their minds, overcome human limitations and use their willpower to affect the physical world, and even to see beyond the barriers of time and space. Some, though, are nothing more than intensely focused skills, or unusual knacks developed in a rarely used part of the brain.

Characters with psychic abilities are called **psychics**, and this section refers to them as such.

### How Psychic Abilities Work

Psychic abilities work like skills, though not everyone can have them. They are rated and rolled like skills. Sometimes, in addition to a successful roll on D100, the psychic must also succeed in a resistance roll. This may be the target’s POW if they do not want to be influenced, their INT if the psychic ability can be ‘outsmarted’, or even the SIZ of an object being lifted telekinetically. If there is no opposing force, a successful psychic ability roll simply works.

### Cost of Psychic Abilities

Most psychic abilities use power points. A psychic reduced to 0 power points is unconscious and cannot use any psychic abilities. Unless specified in the power’s description, the cost is spent regardless of success or failure, with the following conditions or exceptions:

- If the cost of a psychic ability is lower than 1 point per combat round (such as a single power point being spent across several combat rounds), it does not cost anything until the outcome of the psychic ability skill roll is determined.
- An ability costing more than 1 power point to use costs only 1 point if the roll to use it is a failure.
- If the psychic ability roll is a fumble, the full power points to be spent are lost.

### Increasing Psychic Abilities

Like skills, psychic abilities increase with experience. Whenever a successful psychic ability roll is made in combat or when in danger, mark the psychic ability for an experience check later. Psychic abilities can be increase through training and research (see **Skill Training**).

### Using Psychic Abilities

Using a psychic ability against an opponent requires a resistance roll of POW vs. POW or current power points vs. current power points, based on the psychic ability. If the target is willing, there is no need for a resistance roll—success is automatic if the skill roll is successful, and the power points are spent. An unconscious target automatically loses the resistance roll.

Instantaneous psychic abilities can be performed during the powers phase of a combat round, using the psychic’s INT rank to determine who goes first. Abilities that take longer than an instant must be announced, and the skill rolled on the DEX rank. The psychic ability itself occurs during the powers phase of the next round.

### Psychic Ability Success Levels

Some psychic abilities are either successful or unsuccessful, but most, like skills, allow for different levels of success. Rather than determine outcomes per ability, the following guidelines are suggested:

- **Fumble:** Spectacular failure, costing all intended power points. Make a successful Idea roll to avoid being stunned for the rest of the combat round.
- **Failure:** No effect, costing 1 power point.
- **Success:** The desired effect is achieved (though a resistance roll may be required), costing requisite power points.
- **Special Success:** Success, plus one of the following effects, as appropriate, chosen by the gamemaster: half power point cost (minimum 1), double range, double duration, damage doubled, superior quality of information, psychic’s characteristic value is multiplied by 1.5 (round up) for the duration.
- **Critical Success:** A perfect success, plus one of the following effects, as appropriate, chosen by the gamemaster: power point cost is only 1, triple range; triple duration, damaged doubled with no protection allowed, exceptional quality of information provided, psychic’s characteristic value is doubled for the duration.

Your gamemaster may allow you to pick special or critical effects, where appropriate.

### Starting Psychic Abilities

Psychics often develop their abilities in secrecy, sometimes with a mentor or within a clandestine organization or tradition. The campaign’s setting may have more of an influence than the power level but use the following guidelines for each game power level. For any starting skill ratings, spend skill points from your personal skill point pool to improve them.

- **Normal:** Two psychic abilities at skill ratings equal to their POW×1.
- **Heroic:** Four psychic abilities at skill ratings equal to their POW×1.
- **Epic:** Six psychic abilities at skill ratings equal to their POW×1.
- **Superhuman:** Ten psychic abilities at skill ratings equal to their POW×1.

In settings where psychic abilities are weaponized (in government or corporate environments), skill points can come from the professional skill pool in addition to the personal skill pool. Add the Mental skill category modifier if that optional system is used.

### Gaining New Psychic Abilities

When a psychic’s POW has increased beyond its starting value, they can learn a new psychic ability through one of the following methods:

- **Training:** A new psychic ability may emerge through intense training, usually with a mentor who has that psychic ability at 75%+. The time required is weeks equal to the psychic’s POW minus 30. At the end of this period, the psychic must sacrifice 1 point of permanent POW and make a Luck roll, If successful, the new ability is rated at POW×1 (after the subtraction). If they fail, they can try again after another period of training and the POW sacrifice.
- **Involuntarily:** A new psychic ability may suddenly develop, without conscious choice. Speak to your gamemaster and describe the ability you’d like to learn. If your gamemaster agrees, they will provide an opportunity in play where your psychic is put in a stressful situation or opportunity, whether exposure to a mutagen, an intense personal trauma, a flashback, etc. You must then sacrifice 2 permanent points of POW and receive the new psychic ability, rated at your POW x5 (after the subtraction).

As with starting abilities, the Mental skill category modifier, if any, is added to the starting ability rating.

### Increasing POW

POW and power points drive most psychic abilities. These are frequently exercised in POW-based resistance rolls. Whenever a psychic succeeds in a resistance roll vs. a POW higher than their own, put an experience check next to the POW characteristic. See **Increasing Characteristics** for more information.

### Psychic Combat

Psychics in astral form may attack one another in psychic combat. Like physical combat, psychic combat can injure or incapacitate a foe, though in astral form it is more difficult to kill a foe. For psychic combat to occur, both combatants must be in astral form.

To initiate psychic combat, the astral forms must be within POW meters of one another. If these values are different, use the higher POW characteristic as the range. The speed of movement within astral form generally means that each combatant agrees to participate in psychic combat. If they are not, or one chooses to flee, see **Chases on Foot**, using POW as the astral forms’ MOV rate. If required, use each character’s normal Perception skills.

Once combat has been initiated, the outcome is determined with resistance rolls. The attacking character goes first. Use INT instead of DEX to determine in what order the psychic combat will occur.

To attack in psychic combat, the attacker matches their current power points against the defender’s current power point total. Both characters make a power point vs. power point resistance roll.

- If both succeed, attacker and defender each lose 1D3 power points.
- If only one character succeeds, the other character loses 1D3 power points.
- If neither character succeeds, no result occurs that combat round.

Once initiated, psychic combat cannot be disengaged until both combatants agree to stop fighting (usually when one character surrenders), or when one combatant has been incapacitated by being reduced to 0 power points, at which point the psychic is immediately returned to their body, unconscious and out of astral form. If the power points lost in a round exceed the psychic’s current power points (taking them below 0), the excess points are subtracted from current hit points. Psychic combat can be portrayed appropriately to the setting, but the mechanics are the same.

The winner of a psychic combat may immediately continue to attack the loser to try to kill them. The attacker must use a successful Astral Projection roll to get within POW meters of the unconscious loser of the previous psychic combat and continue the attack. No break is allowed between the initial combat and this lethal continuation.

In this case, the attacker pits their power points against the unconscious character’s POW (rather than power points). The procedure is identical to normal psychic combat described above, with the following exceptions:

- If both psychics succeed, each loses 1D3 hit points.
- If only one psychic succeeds, the other loses 1D3 hit points.
- If neither psychic succeeds, the combat ends.

The unconscious psychic must continue the combat until the attacker chooses to end it. If either psychic reaches 0 hit points, the psychic combat is over. A psychic falls unconscious and loses the ability to be in astral form at 0 power points (returning to their body), and a psychic with 0 hit points is dead. If the combat ends with a psychic losing hit points but not dying, lost hit points return at the normal rate.

With a successful Idea roll, a psychic in psychic combat may use other types of powers. As with Astral Projection, a psychic indulged in psychic combat is absent from their body. Some creatures (angels, demons, aliens, etc.) may be able to initiate psychic combat in alternate planes of existence, or even the normal physical world.

The passage of time during psychic combat is equivalent to normal combat rounds in the physical world. If required, such as a situation where combat is ensuing in the physical world simultaneously with the astral plane, any psychic combatants should have their INT ranks compared alongside DEX rankings.

Note that the ability to psychically kill a ‘defenseless’ foe is extremely powerful. Your gamemaster may wish to ignore this, limit it, or substitute it with possession or a loss of SAN.

### Psychic Abilities

Following is a list of psychic abilities.

### Astral Projection

**Range:** POW×10 kilometers

**Duration:** 1 full turn per power point spent

**Power Point Cost:** 1 to activate, 1 per full turn to keep active

The psychic can leave their body and travel in the physical world in their astral form, an invisible, intangible projection of the self. The astral body has the same attributes as the normal body, though in astral form the psychic cannot use any skills to affect the material world. They can see and interact with other astral characters as if they were each in the real world and can do battle as normal. Astral characters can use any magic, psychic, or similar abilities on targets in the physical world, at the gamemaster’s discretion. Some physical protection may protect beings in astral form, depending on the setting. An astral form moves at the psychic’s normal MOV rate, though they can drift, float, or walk as desired. Alternately, if familiar with a location and within range, they can fly there with blinding speed, arriving almost instantaneously.

This ability can be stopped at any time, at which point the astral form returns instantaneously back to the psychic’s body. While using astral form, the psychic’s physical body is comatose. A psychic who runs out of power points while in astral form, begins to lose hit points at a rate of 1 per full turn. If someone interacts with the psychic’s body while they are in astral form and out of sight of the body, a successful Idea roll is required to notice.

Those in astral form may enter **astral space**, a non-physical space that is entirely spiritual in nature and may or may not coincide with the physical world. Psychics can enter astral space by spending 1 additional power point while in astral form. In some settings, ghosts and other powerful supernatural beings may inhabit astral space.

A psychic in astral form may engage in psychic combat. See **Psychic Combat**.

### Aura Detection

**Range:** POW in meters

**Duration:** 1 combat round per power point spent

**Power Point Cost:** 1 to activate, 1 per combat round to keep active

Every living being emits an aura, naked to the human eye, that can reveal information about the soul, origin, and current condition. A psychic can see the aura of another living being and interpret that aura. Once an aura has been detected, an Idea roll can determine whether the being is…:

- …healthy or diseased (and the severity of any disease).
- …benevolent or evil, and how much so.
- …full of power points, overcharged, low, or depleted.
- …relative power on a “much stronger, stronger, equal to, weaker, much weaker” scale vs. the psychic.

Auras are usually mixes of several different colors, with strong colors indicating extremes. A successful Spot roll may detect subtle changes or minor elements of an aura, such as deception. A character possessed by another being (like a ghost or demon) displays the aura of the supernatural being rather than their own. This power may also reveal the presence of any supernatural forces at work on the subject (curses, blessings, or magic items in their possession).

Once used, the ability can be active as long as desired, and be ended instantaneously. It can function while using normal Perception skills and may provide a +20% bonus to any Perception attempts against a living being.

Mind Shield works against Aura Detection.

### Clairvoyance

**Range:** 10×POW in kilometers

**Duration:** 1 full turn per power point spent

**Power Point Cost:** 1 to activate, 1 per full turn to keep active

The psychic can project their full awareness into another area, experiencing that area as if present there. The ability is _Difficult_ if the psychic has never been to the target location. This awareness is limited to the senses—the psychic has not physically gone anywhere, nor has their soul, such as with Astral Projection. The information is current—it does not allow sight into the past, future, another dimension, or timeline. The psychic cannot interact with the environment being visited, though they can attempt Communication-, Mental-, and Perception-based skills or some psychic abilities (such as Psychometry) for more information. The gamemaster should determine whether anyone can sense the psychic’s presence, and how. The psychic cannot use any other psychic ability while using Clairvoyance or the viewing ends. At the end of the duration, the psychic’s senses return, or they may end the ability immediately beforehand.

### Cryokinesis

**Range:** POW in meters

**Duration:** Instantaneous or 1 full turn

**Power Point Cost:** 3 power points per 1D6 in damage or per 3 points of SIZ

The psychic can create an intense cold around a single being or object within range. This does damage to living beings by pitting their current power points vs. the target’s CON as a resistance roll. If you are successful, the target takes 1D6 points of damage per 3 power points spent on Cryokinesis (the point cost must be declared before the attack). Additionally, any environmental effects are also applied. If the target has some protection such as winter wear, this may serve as limited armor against the damage. Cryokinesis can also be used to cover an item or section of floor with ice, to freeze a liquid, or to make an item brittle and easier to shatter. Whenever the target’s SIZ is applicable, the power affects 1 SIZ point per power point spent. Any ice remaining from this power lasts for 1 full turn in normal weather; though it only delivers damage when it is first used.

### Danger Sense

**Range:** POW in meters

**Duration:** Instantaneous or 1 combat round

**Power Point Cost:** 0 power points if passive, 1 power point to activate, 1 per combat round to keep active

The psychic can sense immediate threats from the nearby vicinity—such as a sniper, sneak attack, or trap—in an area they are in or entering. This psychic ability takes the form of a neck-hairs sort of tingle, or a sudden hunch, or even a vision. Your gamemaster always rolls secretly for this power’s outcome. A special success gains an impression of the exact direction a threat is coming from, and a critical success provides further insight into the nature of the threat, such as the type of trap or identity of the attacker.

It can be used actively or passively, with different conditions for each mode:

- When used actively, the psychic spends 1 power point to scan another character or area to determine if danger is present. The chance of success is equal to the ability’s chance, and if successful the gamemaster tells the player what information is gleaned.
- When used passively, the psychic does not need to spend any power points to activate it, though the ability is rolled as if _Difficult_. The gamemaster informs the player if their Danger Sense worked and what it detected.

Further Danger Sense attempts (whether the initial was passive or active) cost 1 power point per additional combat round. If Danger Sense is used successfully in a combat round, the psychic cannot be ambushed, surprised, or flanked, and can parry or dodge as appropriate without penalty until their DEX rank in the next combat round.

### Dead Calm

**Range:** Self

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Power Point Cost:** 1 power point or more if used to delay sanity point loss

The psychic is never rattled, using Dead Calm reflexively when confronted with a force that would stun or otherwise incapacitate them through mental shock. When a shock or psychic attack happens, they can perform this as a reaction, like a parry. If successful, they ignore the stun and can act as normal.

Additionally, Dead Calm delays the effects of sanity point loss (see **Sanity**). To delay the negative effects of sanity point loss, make a Dead Calm roll. If unsuccessful, the effects are suffered as normal. If successful, the psychic can spend any desired number of power points and match them vs. the lost sanity points as a resistance roll. If successful, the effects of the sanity point loss are delayed for full turns equal to the psychic’s POW characteristic. At the end of this time, the sanity point loss and its effects are suffered. Until that time the psychic can act normally, even making plans against their impending sanity breakdown. This delayed sanity point loss cannot be avoided or lessened by any means.

See **Sanity** for more information. If the sanity system is not used in the game, this aspect of the Dead Calm psychic ability has no function.

### Divination

**Range:** Self

**Duration:** 10 hours to perform (–1 hour per additional power point spent), actual vision is instantaneous

**Power Point Cost:** 10 power points (+1 per hour of preparation reduced)

The psychic can commune with a higher force, whether a deity or some spiritual entity, to gain insight into a situation or question, or to receive information about the course of future events. Divination takes time—each attempt requires 10 hours of meditation, ritual preparation, burning of incense, consumption of sacred foods, fasting, flagellation, etc. as appropriate. The Divination roll is made at the end of the duration, the power points spent regardless of success or failure.

You may spend additional power points on a Divination attempt, with each additional power point above the normal cost lowering the preparation time by 1 hour (minimum 1 hour).

**_For example,_** _the normal cost is 10 power points, and it takes 10 hours. Spending 15 power points will reduce the time to 5 hours (10–5=5)._

A psychic who expends their last power point immediately collapses and if the roll was successful, awakens later with the results of the Divination in their memory, experienced as if in a dream.

When this psychic ability is used successfully, the psychic must announce what the question or subject of the Divination is. The more explicit, the more specific the answer. Following are suggested results for the roll, which your gamemaster should roll secretly:

- **Fumble:** Information is misleading or impossible to understand. The psychic believes this information is correct.
- **Failure:** Vision is murky, difficult to interpret, possibly even contradictory. The psychic is aware they have failed.
- **Success:** An insight that provides one answer, a short hint or suggestion that feels right.
- **Special Success:** A solid and clear answer, with a sense of absolute certainty about it.
- **Critical Success:** Thorough information, a clear and immediate instruction, perhaps even provided by an encounter with the force being questioned (a god, entity, etc.).

Based on the setting and nature of the entity, ritual preparations may increase the chance by +5–20%. **Allegiance** can be used to augment Divination rolls.

### Eidetic Memory

**Range:** Self

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Power Point Cost:** 1 power point or more

The psychic can recall information from previous experiences with meticulous attention to detail. A successful roll allows recall of all information about anything they have witnessed or read, up to their POW in years. Additional power points can be spent to increase the number of years: multiply the number of power points spent by the psychic’s POW for the total years, up to their moment of birth. A successful Eidetic Memory roll lets the psychic attempt other based rolls as if present at that time, though this is strictly memory, and they cannot alter past events. The ability is instantaneous, though use of Perception-based skills to investigate memories may take additional time, though no additional power points or roll are required.

### Emotion Control

**Range:** POW×10 meters

**Duration:** 1 full turn per power point spent

**Power Point Cost:** 1 power point per 3 INT to activate, 1 per full turn to keep active

The psychic can control the emotional state of one or more sentient beings, with a successful use of Emotion Control manipulating 3 points of INT in a selected being. Each additional point spent increases the affected INT by +3, and the psychic must spend enough power points to match or go over the target’s INT (thus, the cost is 1/3 the target’s INT, rounded up). To use Emotion Control, overcome the target’s current power points vs. the psychic’s current power points in a resistance table roll (the cost is paid after the resistance roll is made). If successful, the psychic controls the target’s emotional state and can introduce or sustain a desired emotion (love, trust, hatred, fear, lust, calm, etc.). Special or critical successes may increase the duration or intensity. A fumble triggers the emotional state within the caster!

Once successful, Emotion Control remains active at a cost of 1 power point per additional combat round. If the target remains within range and does not break free (see below), the target continues to feel the chosen emotion.

The target must be able to naturally feel the intended emotional state (robots or aliens may be immune). The target cannot be forced to act in a suicidal fashion and is not mind controlled. Instead, the ability sways their actions or reactions, rather than forcing them into unwanted activity. The target may attempt an Idea roll to recognize the influence.

To control two or more targets, each is handled as a separate Emotion Control roll and POW vs. INT resistance roll. Power point costs are figured separately.

A target that has been successfully controlled can attempt to break the control with a new resistance roll at the beginning of each subsequent full turn. Each full turn after being controlled, the target can make a resistance roll of their INT vs. your character’s current power points (now instead of POW). Success means the target breaks free and can act accordingly. Once a target has broken free, a successful Idea roll reveals the attempt to influence them. With a special success, they will recognize the person responsible. Similarly, the psychic must make an Idea roll to recognize when a target has broken free if it is not obvious.

Mind Shield works against this ability.

### Empathy

**Range:** POW in meters

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Power Point Cost:** 1 power point

The psychic can read a target’s emotional state to determine their innermost emotional state. The psychic must be able to see the target or sense them with another psychic ability. If the power roll is successful, a resistance roll of POW vs. the target’s POW yields insight into their emotional state. Success reveals the dominant state of emotion the target is currently experiencing. A special success reveals the origin of the emotional state (the cause, the person responsible, etc.), and a critical success reveals what the target plans to do about that emotional state. Failure yields nothing, while a fumble provides false or misleading information. With a successful Idea roll, the target recognizes that their feelings have been revealed to someone, and with a successful INT×1 roll, discerns the source of the spying.

Mind Shield works against this ability.

### Intuition

**Range:** 100 meters per power point spent

**Duration:** 1 full turn per power point spent

**Power Point Cost:** 1 to activate

The psychic can make intuitive leaps beyond the bounds of normal perception. With a successful roll, the psychic can specify one type of thing they are looking for, such as a trap, lost item, secret door, valuable item, hidden safe, concealed weapon, or even the concealed thoughts of another character. Your gamemaster will then provide the direction to the nearest example of such an item (or type of thing) within range. Additional power points can be spent to increase the range, by 100 meters per additional power point spent.

If desired, Intuition can be used as a passive ability, with your gamemaster rolling secretly and allowing hints or guesses to help guide the course of the adventure. When used in this passive manner, no power points are expended.

**Note:** This is potentially a disruptive power for some types of games, and your gamemaster may choose to disallow it.

### Levitation

**Range:** POW in meters

**Duration:** 1 full turn per power point spent

**Power Point Cost:** 1 power point per 3 SIZ points

The psychic can lift 3 SIZ points per power point spent, whether their own body or another living being. Levitation does not require a resistance roll—a successful roll lifts the weight to the height of the psychic. Levitation is a relaxing form of movement, and direction and speed can be adjusted as instinctively as while walking. Levitation can be used to cross chasms or other similar obstacles, up to the power points spent in meters horizontally, and can bypass hazardous terrain (see **Slippery or Unstable Surfaces**). While levitating, the psychic can continue to remain lifted indefinitely, provided they have enough power points available. Levitation does not require conscious thought to maintain, though if attacked mentally or physically, the psychic must make an Idea roll to keep afloat. Failure means the ability ends and the lifted subject drops to the ground, but gradually enough to avoid falling damage.

An unwilling target must make a resistance roll of their current power points vs. the psychic’s current power points. Similarly, moving a Levitating target in an undesired direction requires a resistance roll of POW vs. POW to determine the outcome of the struggle. Levitation can be released at any time, though the fall does not cause damage. An unwilling target that defeats the psychic in a POW vs. POW roll is released.

To move inanimate objects or to forcefully move living creatures, use Telekinesis.

### Mind Blast

**Range:** POW in meters

**Duration:** Until target recovers

**Power Point Cost:** 1 power point per 3 POW affected

The psychic can make a mental attack, stunning the target. This attack does not cause damage, but overwhelms the opponent, potentially putting them at a disadvantage. If the power roll is successful, make a resistance roll of the psychic’s current power points vs. the target’s current power points. Each use of the power costs 1/3 the target’s POW (rounded up) paid after the resistance roll is made. Success stuns the target for 1D6 combat rounds. Stunned characters can recover normally, as described in that section (see **Stunning or Subduing**). On a special success, the target is knocked unconscious for 1D6 full turns. For a critical success, the duration is 1D6 hours.

Whether the Mind Blast succeeded or failed, the target realizes they were attacked. A successful Idea roll reveals who attacked if it is not obvious.

### Mind Control

**Range:** POW in meters

**Duration:** 1 full turn per power point spent

**Power Point Cost:** 1 power point per 3 points of target’s POW (round up) +1 point per additional combat round

The psychic can dominate the actions and free will of another intelligent being. If the power roll is successful, the psychic must win a power point vs. power point roll against the target. This costs 1 power point per 3 points of the target’s POW (round up), paid after the resistance roll is made. If successful, the psychic gains control of the target’s movement and speech, though the psychic gains no insight into the target’s mind or physical state. This control is complete, though once per combat round, the dominated target may attempt POW×1 roll to ignore or hesitate at the control if an action is contrary to their will. Once control has been established, the psychic can continue to control the target by spending 1 power point per combat round.

To have the target do anything other than lie down and fall asleep, the psychic must concentrate, using no other psychic abilities, doing nothing more than moving slowly and speaking briefly to others. If interrupted, the psychic must make a successful Luck roll (_Difficult_ if injured) or the target is automatically released. A mind-controlled target can attempt to break the control with a new resistance roll on their DEX rank each combat round by succeeding in a POW vs. POW roll against their controller. Success means that they break free and can act at the beginning of the next combat round. With a successful Idea roll, they know they were controlled. A special or critical success restores memories of actions taken while controlled and reveals the identity of their controller. If the Idea roll fails, they have no idea they were mind-controlled.

Mind Control cannot be used on animals or those without living brains and psychic processes, such as a zombie, robot, or ghost. Controlling an alien or creature with vastly different mental structure may be _Difficult_.

### Mind Shield

**Range:** Self

**Duration:** 1 full turn per power point spent

**Power Point Cost:** 1 power point or more to activate

To use Mind Shield against psychic attacks, the psychic must make a successful roll and declare how many power points they are going to spend. Each point of Mind Shield is used as a resistance roll vs. the power points spent in a psychic attack or influence. Mind Shield can be used prior to any threat, or can be used like a parry attempt, raised as a reaction to an incoming influence. Keep Mind Shield active for another full turn by spending power points when the previous use is about to expire.

Mind Shield also works against passive psychic abilities such as Empathy or psychic detection that might detect the psychic, but it must already be in effect to avoid notice. If sanity is being used, each point of Mind Shield already actively protects against 1 sanity point loss per horrific encounter, applied when a loss to SAN is being determined.

For influences other than psychic abilities, each point in Mind Shield temporarily increases the psychic’s POW by 3 for resistance rolls. Mind Shield is especially useful against Emotion Control, Mind Blast, and Mind Control.

### Precognition

**Range:** Self

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Power Point Cost:** 1 power point to activate plus 1 power point per step in time (see the **Time Step Table**, below)

The psychic gains a brief, intuitive glimpse into the future. The farther into the future, the more points it costs.

#### Time Step Table

|Power Points|Time Step|
|---|---|
|1|One combat round|
|2|Ten combat rounds|
|3|One full turn|
|4|One hour|
|5|One day|
|6|One week|
|7|One month|
|8|One year|
|9|Ten years|
|10|100 years|
|11+|Etc.|

Precognition can be used actively or passively. In either case, your gamemaster rolls for the ability and announces the results (if any) to you. The results are as follows:

- **Fumble:** A clear and coherent vision that is completely inaccurate and misleading.
- **Failure:** An incomprehensible or contradictory flash of insight that does little other than provide an uneasy feeling about a situation and the knowledge that the attempt has failed.
- **Success:** A glimpse into the future up to the time step specified, providing a strong impression of what is to come.
- **Special:** A view of the future in considerable detail, providing an intuitive sense as to how things will transpire. A successful Idea roll provides guidance as to what actions must be done (if any) to bring about or avoid that outcome.
- **Critical:** A crystal-clear vision of the future including the series of events that immediately precede it, with a clear idea of how to prevent or ensure that outcome.

Active Precognition lets the psychic spend as many power points to see as far into the future as they want, then the gamemaster rolls and announces the results, as above. Once the points are spent, the psychic must make a successful Idea roll to interpret the vision, if there is anything vague or confusing about it.

With passive Precognition, your gamemaster secretly rolls for the ability, and if successful, provides a glimpse into the future. In this case, the player may not know the dice are being rolled at all. There is no power point cost for passive use of this psychic ability, and your gamemaster may wish to have some aspect of the environment or situation prompt a precognitive glimpse into the future, perhaps as a dramatic or narrative tool.

**Note:** Precognition inevitably implies predestination and may require considerable effort on behalf of your gamemaster to bring about effectively. Its role is entirely subject to your gamemaster’s preference, and they should carefully consider its use and impact on gameplay before allowing it, perhaps even adding some long- or short-term drawbacks, such as sanity or fatigue point cost.

### Psychometry

**Range:** Self

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Power Point Cost:** 1 power point per SIZ point of object, plus 1 point per time step

Objects and environments are psychic sponges, absorbing charged emotions and impressions from those who use and inhabit them, or events that transpired involving them. Psychometry allows a psychic to examine an inanimate item or place and sense the absorbed emotions. This power is only for inanimate objects.

For objects, make a Psychometry roll and spend the power points equivalent to the SIZ of the item (minimum 1, see **Object SIZ Examples**) plus power points equivalent to the last time the item was used (see the **Time Step Table** in Precognition, opposite). A successful Idea roll allows identification of the user of an object if it is someone the psychic has met. For someone they have not met but know of (picture, television, etc.), the Idea roll is _Difficult_. The psychic sees one instance of its previous use, or more if they are relatively identical. A psychic can also use Psychometry to determine any special activating code or term used for a device, from a combination for a lock to the magic word that allows a magic wand to be used. This can be attempted only once for each item.

For an area, choose some subset of that area to gain an impression and use the SIZ guidelines as above.

**_For example,_** _rather than try to use Psychometry on an entire car (SIZ 60), use it on a car seat (which is human-sized, roughly SIZ 8)._

Failure means the psychic cannot try again on the specific item or place until their skill with Psychometry has increased.

Your gamemaster may use this ability passively, rolling secretly when the psychic handles an object or enters an area of note, and announcing a sudden flash of insight about a place or thing. Passive gamemaster-promoted use of the psychic ability does not cost any power points.

**Note:** Psychometry is extremely powerful and can potentially derail a mystery, providing information beyond what your gamemaster wishes. Thus, your gamemaster may choose to disallow this psychic ability. Additionally, it is up to your gamemaster’s discretion whether Psychometry will work on a corpse.

### Pyrokinesis

**Range:** POW in meters

**Duration:** Instantaneous, or 1 combat round

**Power Point Cost:** 3 power points per 1D6 damage or 3 SIZ points

Pyrokinesis creates intense heat, filling an area with flame, potentially igniting an object, even providing light or warmth. It can be shaped and otherwise manipulated. The area affected is equal to 3 SIZ per 3 power points. Successful use against a living being inflicts 1D6 points of damage per 3 power points used. Additional power points increase damage (6 points = 2D6 damage, etc.) If the target has some protection such as insulating clothing, this may serve as armor against the damage. Damage is instantaneous, though the heat lingers for an additional combat round or longer.

Pyrokinesis can melt items, matching the power points spent vs. the object’s SIZ in a resistance roll. Any appropriate environmental effects are also applied, where relevant (see **Fire and Heat**). Your gamemaster may choose to modify the number of power points required for substances based on their melting points.

Pyrokinesis can also snuff out flame by draining the oxygen it requires, cancelling a volume of flame SIZ on a point-by-point basis.

### Sensitivity

**Range:** Self

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Power Point Cost:** 1 power point

This psychic awareness allows the psychic to recognize some supernatural or spiritual aspects of an object or area or to detect the presence of supernatural beings or spirits nearby. Negative emotional, spiritual, or supernatural aspects create foreboding and unease, and positive aspects foster a sense of peace and harmony. If the impressions are coming from an object within the psychic’s immediate vicinity (1/3 POW in meters), an Idea roll identifies that object. Sensitivity also informs whether other psychic abilities are being used or have recently been used in the area, or even if someone nearby has recently used psychic abilities in an extreme fashion.

Your gamemaster may wish to use the ability passively, rolling secretly and announcing any sudden flash of Sensitivity. In these cases, it costs no power points to use.

**Note:** Sensitivity can potentially derail mystery-based plots, and your gamemaster may choose to disallow it entirely. In some settings, this may be the sole psychic ability present.

### Telekinesis

**Range:** POW in meters

**Duration:** 1 combat round

**Power Point Cost:** 1 power point per 3 SIZ each combat round

The psychic can lift objects and move them with their mind. Every power point spent affects 3 SIZ points. To use the power, determine the SIZ of the object to be moved and divide its SIZ by 3 (round up). If the Telekinesis is successful, the psychic can pick up the object and move it in the air or along the ground at normal MOV speed. The object must stay within range of the psychic. Every point spent above the SIZ extends the range it can be thrown by another 15 meters, or increases the speed to double (triple, etc.) normal MOV. If something has wheels and/or is dragged across level ground, each point affects 6 SIZ. Once an item is held with Telekinesis, the psychic can hold it indefinitely if they spend the power points to keep it aloft. If knocked unconscious or dealt a major wound, the item falls to the ground. If distracted, attacked, or attempting a complex task, make a successful Idea roll to maintain the hold.

If using Telekinesis to pick up an unwilling target, the psychic must defeat them in a POW vs. SIZ resistance roll. No roll is required for a willing target. Telekinesis cannot lift the psychic themselves: to do that, use Levitation.

To use Telekinesis to hit someone with an object, make a Throw roll once an object is held aloft. Objects thrown at other characters do 1D6 points of damage per 10 points of SIZ, or the object’s normal damage if it is a missile weapon. The damage modifier is based on the psychic’s POW+INT (instead of STR+SIZ) on the **Damage Modifier Table**. To catch an item with Telekinesis, make a successful _Difficult_ Throw or Agility roll (pick) and spend enough power points to handle the item.

Additionally, Telekinesis can be used as armor against physical attacks, each point providing 1 point of armor.

### Telepathy

**Range:** 10×POW in kilometers

**Duration:** 1 combat round per power point spent

**Power Point Cost:** 1 power point to activate or 1 power point per 3 POW

A psychic can read a target’s mind by making a successful Telepathy roll then defeating them in a POW vs. POW resistance roll. If successful, the psychic must then spend 1 power point per 3 points of the target’s POW (divide POW by three, round up). At this point, they have access to the target’s memories and active thoughts through the rest of the combat round until the psychic’s next DEX rank. The resistance roll must be made successfully each round desired. No resistance roll is required with a willing target, and only 1 point is required to use the ability.

Once a telepathic link is made, choose one of the following actions:

- Speak mind-to-mind as equals.
- Pass along a simple or complex message, even sharing a memory or image of something.
- Read surface thoughts and feelings.
- Implant a false memory or create a sensory impression that lasts until the target succeeds in a _Difficult_ Idea roll or the end of the ability’s duration.

**_For example,_** _a psychic might create a false memory of them giving someone a $100 bill or make them think that a playing card is that $100 bill._

- Dig for buried memories or suppressed information in the target’s subconscious. A specific memory may take 1D3 combat rounds, and 1D3+3 rounds for a suppressed or traumatic memory. The target will experience this memory anew, as if remembering it vividly.

Once Telepathy has been established, continue it by spending 1 additional power point each combat round.

The psychic can attempt to affect more than one target at a time. To do so, make each Telepathy roll separately and pay the requisite power points, but also a successful Idea roll to coordinate the multiple simultaneous communications. The actions taken within the minds do not need to be the same.

The psychic can end the connection immediately. Each combat round after the one in which the telepathic link is established, the target can make a new POW vs. POW resistance roll. Success means the telepathic connection ends. With a successful Idea roll, they know that they were in telepathic contact. A special or critical success reveals the identity of the psychic. If the Idea roll fails, the target has no idea they had telepathic contact, only that it was some strange mental phase.

## Sorcery

Sorcery imposes supernatural effects on the physical world through complex occult formulas, formalized as spells. A character who uses sorcery is a **sorcerer**. When a sorcerer says the required words to activate a sorcery spell and spends the required power points, the specific type of magic energy is released and has the desired effect.

Unlike **Magic**, sorcery spells always happen. Rarely is a roll required to activate the spell, and there is no need for any special targeting. Usually, sorcery only fails if the target cannot be overcome with a resistance roll.

### Who Can Use Sorcery?

A sorcerer’s POW characteristic influences the frequency and potency of the sorcery they can cast. To be able to cast sorcery spells, a sorcerer must have POW 16+. A sorcerer with POW 15 or lower cannot use sorcery, but they can still use enchanted items and other sorcerers can still cast useful spells on them. Often, their power points are a resource for other sorcerers to aid their own spellcasting.

### Starting Sorcery Spells

A sorcerer begins knowing how to inscribe sorcery spells they know into their grimoire, and they know how to ready or dismiss a spell. Additionally, they already possess a grimoire tailored to their tastes. They know spells depending on the following power levels, and all known spells are inscribed in their grimoires:

- **Normal:** Up to ½ INT (round up) in levels of spells known.
- **Heroic:** Up to INT in levels of spells known.
- **Epic:** Up to INT×2 in levels of spells known and/or marked in their grimoire.
- **Superhuman:** Up to INT×4 in levels of spells known and/or marked in their grimoire.

A sorcerer can keep up to their INT in spell levels stored in their mind at any time, so any beyond this are in their grimoire, available but not ready.

### Power Points and Sorcery

After casting spells, a sorcerer grows tired, having spent their energy into the sorcery, fueling it. Power points are spent to cast sorcery and return naturally. A sorcerer cannot spend more power points than they possess, nor can their power points regenerate above their POW. Power points over POW can be spent but do not regenerate.

Some powerful spells may require a sorcerer to spend permanent points of POW as well as power points. Other spells require special herbs, potions, words, or other components. Your gamemaster may rule that additional requirements are necessary, or none at all. If a powerful spell demands sacrifice of POW and power points, the sorcerer’s power points regenerate only to the new POW. If a sorcerer’s POW increases, their power points regenerate to the new value.

### Sorcery Spell Limitations

A sorcerer’s INT is the limit to the maximum number of spell levels they have immediate access to. Spells are cast from spells in memory. To cast a spell not in memory, dismiss some other spell to make room.

A human can remember levels of individual spells up to or equal to their INT. Bound demons and elementals also count against this limit. Enchanted items are independent of the INT limit, and do not count against this total. At your gamemaster’s discretion, some cultures with an affinity for magic may have additional capacity for spell memorization.

Think of a sorcerer’s mind like a shelf: spells sit on that shelf. A sorcerer’s INT determines how many items they can have on the shelf at one time. To learn new sorcery while at the INT limit, one must dismiss a spell from memory, essentially taking one thing off the shelf to make room for another.

List all the spells in a sorcerer’s grimoire in the **Powers** section on the character sheet and indicate if the spell is ‘In Memory’.

Once a spell is dismissed, it must be reacquired from a grimoire. A grimoire is a collection that contains spells and sorcerous information. Traditionally, a grimoire is a book or series of books, but it can be a scroll (or scrolls), a computer file, a recording, or almost any means of storing information. Work with your gamemaster for more unusual formats. When your sorcerer character learns a new spell, it can automatically be put into their grimoire.

A sorcerer who loses their grimoire can automatically re-record any spells they currently have in memory and may be able to recall other spells the grimoire contained. Once per day, a sorcerer can attempt to roll INT×l or lower. Success means that the sorcerer recalls one spell, or some other bit of lore that was in the lost grimoire (your choice). Failure means no useful information is recalled at that time, and another attempt must wait until the next day.

### When Can Sorcery Be Used?

Spells usually take one combat round to cast. Sorcery in memory is available for use in the Powers phase of the combat round. Sorcery that is not in memory can be readied through different means but is generally not usable during physical combat.

### Learning Sorcery

Sorcerers learn spells in one of four ways: scholarly research, studying a grimoire, being taught, or accepting the gift of sorcery from a powerful supernatural force.

### Scholarly Research

This option requires a library in a language (or languages) the sorcerer can read. Your gamemaster should determine the **library rating**, a multiplier from ×1–3; the higher, the better the sources. They then determine the language(s) of the library’s resources. A sorcerer then attempts to either find a new spell or recreate one that may exist somewhere in the library.

Your gamemaster rolls 1D10 secretly to determine the number of weeks needed to attempt to learn the spell, subtracting –1 week for each 50% in relevant language(s) the sorcerer knows to a minimum of 1 week. When the required time has passed, roll D100: success is equal to or less than the sorcerer’s INT multiplied by the library’s rating.

If the roll is successful, the spell is learned and inscribed in the sorcerer’s personal grimoire. A failed roll means that the sorcerer must spend another 1D10 weeks (modified as above) before they can attempt another INT×(library rating) roll.

If the goal is an invocation or summoning of a particular deity, a temple to that deity is likely to contain the proper information. Research in a temple is the same as in a library, but access may be even more restricted. Your gamemaster should determine what access a sorcerer may have, and such a request may involve some form of service to the temple.

### Studying a Grimoire

A grimoire is a collection of spells, lore, formulas, and rituals. Though these rules refer to a grimoire as a type of book, a grimoire might be a scroll, a staff carved with runes, or some other sort of record, perhaps protected with a code, written in a secret language, or obscured through some other means.

Every sorcerer automatically owns a grimoire inscribed with the spell(s) they know. Traditionally, the grimoire is automatically updated whenever a new spell or other information is learned. No roll is required to do so, and it is assumed to always be successful.

Grimoires allow a character to know more sorcery than their INT allows, ensuring that sorcery is available even when it is not in memory. Grimoires have no maximum or minimum size. Nothing limits a grimoire’s capacity. A sorcerer can start a new or duplicate grimoire at any time. An empty grimoire is just a book with blank pages, ready to be filled with sorcery spells. The only expense is the cost of the actual physical object of the grimoire—the fancier, the more expensive.

Grimoires can be written in a variety of languages, including magical languages. Your gamemaster should determine the language of any other grimoire if one is introduced. A sorcerer must be able to read the writing to learn from the grimoire. A sorcerer with a skill rating of less than INT×5 in the language the grimoire is written in must make a successful Language roll whenever the grimoire is used.

Other grimoires can come into a sorcerer’s possession through several ways and are often prized possessions. A grimoire for sale may be a musty tome that has survived the death of its owner, or it may be a bundle of cheap spiral notebooks scrawled with tiny handwriting and disturbing pictures. Or it could even be a meticulously organized data file, complete with audio files to assist in pronouncing the difficult passages of the spell, copiously annotated.

The spells and summonings in a grimoire may be set down incompletely or deliberately incorrect and may include subtle traps to guard against thieves. References, measurements, and wordings of the spell description are likely to be allusive and baffling. Learning from an old grimoire is often tedious and difficult: the older the grimoire, the more involved the process is likely to be.

To learn a spell from another person’s grimoire, a sorcerer can attempt a roll of equal to or lower than their INT×l for every three game weeks of study. With a successful roll, the spell is in memory and ready to be cast (and has been transferred to the sorcerer’s own grimoire).

### Being Taught

Learning a spell from a teacher may be quicker than creating it or deciphering it from a grimoire.

- The teacher must know the spell and be able to cast it successfully.
- A sorcerer can learn one spell at a time.
- The student must attempt a roll of their INT×1. Success means that the spell is in memory and ready to cast. The spell can then be transcribed to the student’s grimoire.

### Accepting Sorcery as a Gift

A powerful supernatural entity like a god, angel, demon, etc. may grant the ability to use a spell through one of the following methods:

- The supernatural being might simply place the spell into the sorcerer’s memory (eliminating another spell to make room, if necessary), as if the sorcerer had learned the spell. They can then write the spell down in their grimoire.
- The spell might be on a scroll, in a book, a shard of some precious metal, a data file, or a banner bearing the words of the spell. It can be learned if it can be read.
- The spell may be imbued into an enchanted object of some sort.
- The spell may not even be taught to the sorcerer, but instead, they can call upon the supernatural entity and ask it to cast the spell on their behalf.

A gift of sorcery may come with strings attached, known or unknown, and should be accepted cautiously.

### Readying and Dismissing Sorcery

As noted previously, a sorcerer cannot automatically cast any spell they know—spells must be in memory before being cast. You should note on your character’s sheet what spells are in memory and which spells are in their grimoire, perhaps keeping these lists separate from each other to prevent confusion. The _Basic Roleplaying_ character sheet has adequate space for powers, so the front is the best place for ‘ready’ spells, and the back can serve as the grimoire. Alternately, cards or another method can be used to keep them distinct.

To ready a spell, the grimoire should be available, and the relevant spell must exist in that grimoire. Bringing a spell into memory is called readying a spell. Removing a spell from memory is called dismissing a spell. This is done as often as desired: sorcerers often choose their spells based their immediate plans.

**_For example,_** _a sorcerer planning to cast some major spell (like a demon summoning) would ready spells like Brazier of Power, Chain of Being, Refutation, Bolster the Soul, and Witch Sight, along with the Summon Demon spell. If out adventuring, other spells such as Inescapable Bonds, Cloak of Night, Heal, Muddle, Sorcerous Armor, Undo Sorcery, and a weapon enhancement may be more appropriate._

Reading and comprehending a spell in the grimoire takes one combat round for each point of the spell to be readied. For spells that vary in points, the number of combat rounds needed always equals the maximum value known.

**_For example,_** _it takes four combat rounds to read Hammer of the Gods (4) from the grimoire and have it ready to cast._

If a spell requires 20 power points to cast, then a sorcerer needs 20 combat rounds to ready it.

Dismissing a spell is much easier. It is instantaneous and can be done at the same time as readying another spell. A demon or elemental can also be dismissed just as quickly, releasing it from service and allowing it to control its own fate. How the creature reacts is up to its nature, the way it was treated, and the relative balance of power between it and its former master.

### Spells in Play

If a single number or fixed cost is given for a sorcery spell, the effect always costs that many power points. If the power point cost varies, select the strength of the spell by choosing a number from the given range.

Unless noted, spells successfully cast take effect automatically (see **Other Planes** for exceptions). Once a sorcery spell is cast, it cannot be recalled.

Some spells are not necessarily detectable by observers, while others are obviously the product of sorcery. A sorcerer will always recognize the effects of a spell they know when it is cast, regardless of who is casting it and what cosmetic elements it has been described with.

Generally, demons, elementals, and other supernatural creatures cannot use sorcery, though sorcery affects them. Demons have their own special abilities that only they possess.

If numerous spells are being cast during an encounter, you might want to use a piece of scratch paper to note spell names, the rounds cast, and spell strengths. Remember to mark off the power points that power the spells.

### Casting a Spell

A spell affects a single person, entity, area, or thing. Since casting takes only one combat round, separate uses of the same spell can strike additional target(s) in later combat rounds.

Spells are cast on the powers phase of a combat round, in order of a sorcerer’s INT. The spell takes effect in INT order of the Powers phase of the next combat round.

After a sorcerer begins casting a spell, they can do nothing else during that combat round. In case of a distraction (being attacked, taking damage, a loud noise or surprise, significant movement, etc.) make an Idea roll to resist being distracted. If the roll is successful, the spell is cast without incident. If the roll fails, the spell is not cast, and the power points are lost. Extreme distractions might make the Idea roll _Difficult_.

### Duration

A spell’s duration equals the sorcerer’s POW in combat rounds.

**_For example,_** _a sorcerer with POW 19 casts Hell’s Razor. The spell takes one round to cast, then takes effect in the Powers phase of the next round. It lasts for 18 more combat rounds and expires in the Powers phase of the 20th round._

Once cast, a spell needs no maintenance, and continues in effect whether the target moves out of range.

A sorcerer can extend the duration of any spell by casting it again at any time: the duration extends, but the effect does not intensify. They can choose to end the effects of a spell prematurely: most spells allow this automatically, but others might take more than an instant to cancel. Unless specified otherwise, any ongoing effects of the spell end the moment the sorcerer chooses.

### How to Become a Better Sorcerer

How does a sorcerer become more powerful? Here are three ways to increase POW:

- **Exercising Power:** A sorcerer that has successfully defeated an opponent of equal or greater POW in a POW vs. POW resistance roll can check the box next to the POW on their character sheet. When checking for experience, see **POW Increases**.
- **Sorcerous Heritage:** At your gamemaster’s discretion, when creating a sorcerer, trade 2 points from other characteristics for 1 point of POW, deliberately sacrificing aspects of themselves in exchange for greater prowess with sorcery. Each trade requires a successful Luck roll based on their original POW. Missing a Luck roll ends the chance of any further trades. A result of 00 is always a miss. This method is not compatible with point-based characteristic generation.
- **Gift of the Gods:** During play, a sorcerer may bargain for or plead for a gift of POW from a favorable deity. This is entirely up to the gamemaster and may require promises of service from the sorcerer, good roleplaying, or successful Communication rolls. The grant is never more than 1D3 POW. For each point granted, the recipient must immediately undertake some dangerous task or attempt some dangerous deed that furthers the deity’s agenda.

### Reliability of Sorcery

Some guidelines about how sorcery works:

- Spells and sorcerous items do not generally require rolls to activate.
- Some additional roll may be required—such as Language to read a spell, or a weapon attack to strike a person with a magic item—but the sorcerer does not need to make a roll to make the spell itself happen.
- Spells take effect automatically, though some require resistance rolls or some other condition.
- A sorcerous item works for whomever holds it, so long as they have the capability to do so (STR, DEX, etc.).

### Spot Rules for Sorcery

These spot rules may be of use when dealing with sorcery.

#### Characteristic Effects

Despite a standardized spell list, sorcery is both individual and idiosyncratic. Choose any sounds, gestures, foci, lights, smells, or other characteristics to describe a particular sorcerer’s spellcasting.

#### Enchanted Weapons

When a weapon affected by a spell is given over to another character, or dropped and picked up by another character, the effect is unbroken until the spell expires.

#### Maximum Attack Damage

Sorcery spells on weapons usually augment their average attack damages, but do not increase the maximum damage possible for the attack. The effect of the spell is to boost the average damage done with the attack. **_For example,_** _a normal broadsword does 1D8+1 damage. The rolled damage is 7. With Hell’s Razor 4, the minimum damage is 6 points (1 on a 1D8, +1, and +4 for the spell). The damage can never be more than 9 points, since 9 is the maximum damage that can be rolled for a broadsword attack. Hell’s Razor 4 ensures that each hit does between 6 and 9 points of damage. The damage is 1D8+1+4 but does not do more than 9 points of damage, plus the damage modifier. The spell does not change the damage modifier or the chance to hit. In case of a special or critical success, each damage roll is treated separately, with the same restrictions._

#### Other Planes

Spells have the following effects when cast on beings from other planes (such as demons) or on planes other than where they originated:

- Spells usually work, but not always. If the spell fails for some reason, the power points spent are lost.
- Spells cast with the intention of enhancing entities from other planes, such as casting Sorcerous Armor on a demon or elemental, never work. The power points spent are lost.
- Spells learned on one plane and then cast on another plane may cost double the power points and have ½ the normal duration and effect (round up if necessary). Sorcery spells are no longer automatically assumed to succeed—every time a sorcerer casts a spell on another plane, they must make a successful _Difficult_ Luck roll. If this roll fails, the spell does not work, and the power points spent are lost. This is at your gamemaster’s discretion.
- Demons and elementals do not cast spells. Instead, they have abilities, which are spell-like in function. In some cases, these may be identical to a sorcery spell’s description, though they are intrinsic powers and do not need to be readied and do not have any INT limitations.

#### Resistance Table Procedure

If a spell compares a sorcerer and target’s power points or POW on the resistance table, compare the current points, including those needed to cast the spell (the power points or POW are subtracted from the current total once the spell’s effects have been determined and the resistance roll is completed).

#### Resistant Targets

If a target does not resist, a sorcerer may transfer the effects of most spells by touch. If a target resists, resolve the issue comparing a sorcerer and target’s current power points vs. power points on the resistance table.

#### Spells Cast on an Object or Person?

Spells cast on an object influence that object only. For example, if Hell’s Razor is cast on one sword, it does not increase the damage done by a sword held in the other hand. Two weapons need two spell castings.

The object affected by the spell is independent of the sorcerer, as well. **_For example,_** _a sword with Hell’s Razor cast upon it and used by another person gets the spell’s benefits for the remaining duration. Talons of the Beast is the only weapon-enhancing spell that can be cast on a person._

#### Spells per Object

Only one spell can be cast on a single object at a time. For example, if Unbreakable Bulwark is cast on a shield, it cannot have Sorcerous Armor on it at the same time. If Sorcery’s Sharp Flame is cast on a weapon, then it cannot have Hell’s Razor on it simultaneously. An additional spell cast on an object has no effect and is dissipated, though the power points spent are lost.

#### Spells per Person

Any number of compatible spells may be cast on a person, at your gamemaster’s discretion. If multiple power types (magic spells, mutations, superpowers, etc.) are in effect, your gamemaster should determine if the effects can be stacked and what aspects will be affected.

### Sorcery Spell List

The following list of spells is not exhaustive but represents the most useful spells for adventuring. You and your gamemaster may choose to create additional spells or modify these are you see fit.

Each spell description contains the following:

- **Name & Levels:** A generic title for the spell. Create more evocative names as desired. The number in parentheses is how many levels the spell has. A range means that the spell’s level is variable, and players can choose how many levels of the spell the sorcerer has in memory and can cast. As noted previously, a spell’s level is also the number of power points it takes to cast.
- **Range:** This is either Self (caster only), Touch (caster or anyone or anything they can touch), Sight (anything in the physical line of sight, not relayed by mechanical devices like cameras), or some other definition of distance.

A description of the spell’s actual effects in the world, with any game effects defined where needed.

### Bird’s Vision (1)

**Range:** Sight

The sorcerer can control one bird’s field of vision and see through its vantage point. The bird (or birdlike creature) chosen for this spell must be within eyesight. Once cast, if the bird is lost from view, the spell continues and lasts for its duration. If no bird is present when the spell is cast, it simply does not work. Your gamemaster should announce beforehand if there is nothing to cast the spell on.

### Bolster the Soul (1–3)

**Range:** Touch

The target’s POW is increased by +3 per level of the spell, adding 3, 6, or 9 to POW for the duration. This does not increase power points or contribute to training or any permanent determination using POW. While in effect, the increase to POW does increase the Luck roll and aids in any POW vs. POW resistance rolls, including binding rolls for summoned demons (the point of POW spent to bind a demon must be real, not the temporary POW conferred by the spell).

When casting Bolster the Soul 3 for the maximum increase of +9 points, roll D100. On a result of 00, the spell becomes permanent, and those points are permanently added to the POW of the target. However, after that, the spell does not affect the character anymore, and they become unable to have it cast upon them again. They must also subtract 9 points permanently from other characteristics, in any combination, adjusting any values calculated from those characteristics. If allegiance is used, this adds +1D8 allegiance to whatever force represents randomness and/or change.

### Bounty of the Sea (4)

**Range:** Sight

This spell causes a sudden torrent in a room or within a small portion of open space. The water continues to cascade into the area for the duration. By its end, enough water has fallen from nowhere to fill an average room. Once the spell ends, the water stays and behaves naturally, draining or remaining as appropriate. If the sorcerer is far from a natural body of water, they must make a successful Luck roll before the spell can take effect. This spell is a prerequisite to be able to summon water elementals with the Summon Elemental spell. This spell can be negated by a casting of the Gift of the Earth spell on the same area. This spell can also be cancelled by a 4-point Undo Sorcery spell, but any water already summoned into the area by the spell does not disappear.

### Brazier of Power (4)

**Range:** Touch

The sorcerer can create a reservoir of personal power points to draw upon when summoning more powerful entities or casting many spells. Brazier of Power is incompatible with Chain of Being, and if one is cast on a target, the other will have no effect. Traditionally, the focus for the reservoir is a large brazier, but it could be any sturdy, solid place or thing. If the focus is moved or destroyed, the attunement is lost, and a new focus must be established from scratch.

The first time Brazier of Power is cast, the sorcerer must sacrifice 4 power points and 1 permanent point of POW to attune the focus. Once successful, the sorcerer can store any remaining power points in the focus. The focus accepts new power points at any time up to the maximum of a sorcerer’s POW when the focus was created (after the sacrifice).

**_For example,_** _if a sorcerer’s POW was 17 after the spell was complete (down 1 point from the original 18), they can store up to 17 power points in the Brazier of Power at any time. Whenever the sorcerer wishes, they may sacrifice the stored power points in the Brazier of Power, along with any they have regenerated. The power points in the focus are always the first spent._

The sorcerer must be in physical contact with the brazier to draw power points from it. Only its creator can use the power points directly. However, if they have another means of transferring power points to another character, power points must first be drawn from the sorcerer, then from the brazier. To make a focus of greater capacity, a sorcerer must cast the spell again upon the same item, sacrificing another point of POW and the necessary power points. In this fashion, a Brazier of Power can become an immense reservoir of power points. Many serious sorcerers use Braziers of Power in their lairs or sanctuaries.

### Breath of Life (l)

**Range:** Touch

The sorcerer can breathe normally if they are underwater or in a similar medium. If suddenly immersed, a successful Agility roll may be required to get the spell off beforehand. The sorcerer can also speak normally while underwater.

### Chain of Being (4)

**Range:** Touch, Sight, etc.

This spell allows up to eight individuals to pool their power points into a single shared resource, a useful practice when summoning or binding a demon or elemental or casting some mighty spell beyond the reach of a single sorcerer’s power points. The participants must be linked by touch; usually holding hands in a circle. The circle must be maintained while the power points are being spent on any casting. Only a single casting of Chain of Being is needed per summoning. Only one participant in the spell needs to know this spell for it to work, and the 4 power points spent to cast the spell must come from that sorcerer.

Any power points spent beyond those 4 points are drawn as uniformly as possible from each participant, starting with the caster. If a participant accidentally drops to 0 power points, the chain is broken, the spell ends, and the power points are lost.

This spell is incompatible with Brazier of Power. If the summoned entity (demon, elemental, etc.) is bound, the participants hold it in common, and must agree upon the action or actions it takes. If they cannot agree after it is bound, the summoned creature does nothing. If its service needs to be negotiated or bargained for, only the sorcerer needs to make these skill attempts or offer the terms.

### Cloak of Night (1–4)

**Range:** Touch, Sight, etc.

Each level increases the target’s Hide skill by +20%, cumulative, for the duration.

### Curse of Sorcery (4)

**Range:** Touch

With a successful POW vs. POW resistance roll, the sorcerer can endow part of the target’s body with some gruesome or demonic quality of their choice, such as being extra warm to the touch, slimy, always wet, scaly, extra hairy, warty, multicolor, etc. With a second successful POW vs. POW roll, the targeted body part takes on the appropriate physical appearance of a tentacle, a crab leg, a bird’s wing, an insect feeler, etc. though the appearance is solely cosmetic—no bonuses or abilities are conferred by this curse. If the affected body area is visible, it may cause a loss of 1D3 points of CHA while the spell is in effect. The spell’s effect ends when the caster dies. This spell can only be cast once upon a single target while it is in effect, though it can be repeated if the duration has ended. Casting this spell may cause the sorcerer to gain allegiance points for any force emphasizing cruelty or chaos, and any such disfigurement likely becomes a distinctive feature.

### Farsight (1)

**Range:** Sight

The sorcerer can see something or everything twice as close as it is. While active, each additional casting cumulatively doubles the closeness, allowing for greater magnification.

### Fires of the Sun (4)

**Range:** Sight

A mass of floating fire appears and hangs in any position within line of sight of the sorcerer. The fire burns without fuel for the spell’s duration. The churning flame measures about three meters across, and is hot enough to ignite adjacent materials, doing 1D6+2 fire damage per round. This spell must be known before fire elementals can be summoned or invoked with the Summon Elemental spell. This spell can be negated by the Wings of the Sky spell cast on the area it affects. A 4-point Undo Sorcery will dispel this spell; if so, any flame present falls to the ground and behave naturally (smoldering, perhaps catching twigs and brush afire, etc.).

### Fury (1)

**Range:** Touch

This spell induces a furious, berserk rage in the target, making them fight recklessly and with savage abandon. If the target is unwilling, make a current power point vs. current power point resistance roll. If successful, the recipient of the spell (self or another) fights unceasingly for the duration any target of their choice. The target of the spell can make one additional attack each round (beyond any skill restrictions), performed on the last DEX rank of the round. The spell does not add to the attack skill rank or increase damage done.

This spell lowers the target’s instinct for self-preservation and reduces their skill ratings for any dodges or parries by 30%, in addition to any other modifiers such as for additional actions. The furious character ignores any unconsciousness stemming from a major wound. A fatal wound is still fatal, but they attack until the end of the round of death, striking blows even if technically dead, finally keeling over on DEX rank 1. During this fury, the target only can act in ways related to immediate combat (no magic, no healing, etc.).

### Gift of the Earth (4)

**Range:** Sight

This spell causes a mass of dust, soil, and sand to suddenly appear and accumulate quickly in a small room or small area of open space. When the spell ends, the spell will have transmitted more than 60 cubic meters of new earth, enough to fill an ordinary room. This spell must be known before earth elementals can be summoned or invoked using the Summon Elemental spell. The use of Undo Sorcery 4 defeats this spell, though any earth that has already arrived will remain. The Bounty of the Sea spell negates Gift of the Earth if cast on the same area. If out on a body of water, in the sky, or in space, a successful Luck roll is needed for the spell to work.

### Hammer of the Gods (1–4)

**Range:** Touch

This spell can be cast on a single blunt weapon, like a staff, club, mace, hammer, etc. The effects only apply to blows from blunt weapons; if cast on an edged or pointed weapon, it has no effect or only applies to blunt use of the weapon, such as striking with the hilt. Each level increases the damage roll by +1, up to the maximum damage possible using that weapon. This does not change the wielder’s damage modifier (rolled separately).

### Heal (2)

**Range:** Touch

This immediately heals 1D3 hit points, up to the target’s maximum hit points. It can be cast once per wound. Additionally, it can be used to treat a wound that has already been treated by First Aid and is often used in tandem with First Aid by healers.

### Hell’s Razor (1–4)

**Range:** Touch

This spell can be cast on a single slashing weapon with a cutting edge or edges, such as swords, axes, etc. The effects only apply to blows from edged weapons; if cast on a blunt or impaling weapon, it has no effect unless used in a slashing fashion. Each level increases the damage roll by +1, up to the maximum damage possible using that weapon. This does not change the wielder’s damage modifier (rolled separately).

### Inescapable Bonds (3)

**Range:** Touch

Any living thing this spell is cast upon is seized and held as if bound by invisible chains. The person or thing held cannot significantly move any limb, finger, tentacle, tongue, etc., while the spell is in effect. This only affects living beings, aliens, or animals, with no effect on undead, robots, or vehicles. The target can attempt to break free once per combat round by succeeding in a resistance roll of their STR vs. the sorcerer’s current power points. If successful, the Inescapable Bonds are broken. If unsuccessful, the target can try again next round. A 3-point Undo Sorcery spell cancels Inescapable Bonds.

### Inhuman Plasticity (1–3)

**Range:** Touch

The target’s SIZ is increased or decreased by +3 points per level, adding or subtracting 3, 6, or 9 points to SIZ for the spell’s duration. This can also temporarily increase or decrease damage modifier and hit points. See the rules for **Big and Little Targets** if relevant. Any hit points lost while this spell is in effect are first removed from the temporary hit points. This spell may affect the target’s MOV. The minimum allowable SIZ is 1, so any further points are ignored. The target’s clothes and armor (but not weapons) also change SIZ for the duration.

When casting Inhuman Plasticity 3 for the maximum increase or decrease of 9 points, roll D100. On a result of 00, the effect becomes permanent, and those points are permanently added or subtracted from the target’s SIZ as the spell was cast. However, after that, the spell does not affect the character anymore, and they become unable to have it cast upon them again. They must also subtract 9 points permanently from other characteristics, in any combination, adjusting any values calculated from those characteristics. If allegiance is used, this adds +1D8 allegiance to whatever force represents randomness and/or change.

This spell can also be cast on insects, birds, and other nonhumans.

### Keen Ear (1)

**Range:** Sight

This spell allows two speakers to whisper to each other anywhere within line-of-sight: intervening walls, boulders, forests, etc. negate the spell. Specify the second party to the conversation when the spell is cast. Anyone standing near one of the two involved parties hears only that portion of the conversation. The involved characters hear each other perfectly well, however. Communication, Perception, or language skill rolls might be required where relevant. This spell can be used against enemies, with no resistance roll to prevent its effects.

### Leap (1–4)

**Range:** Touch

Each level increases the target’s Jump skill by +20%, cumulative, for the duration. The distance a sorcerer can jump (see Jump) also increases by +1 meter for each level.

### Lightning Speed (1–3)

**Range:** Touch

The target’s MOV is increased by +1 per level of the spell while the spell is in effect. The spell can be cast on another species, such as a horse. Lightning Speed does not affect DEX.

When casting Lightning Speed 3 for the maximum increase of +3 points, roll D100. On a result of 00, the effect becomes permanent, and those points are permanently added to the target’s MOV. However, after that, the spell does not affect the target anymore, and they become unable to have it cast upon them again. They must also subtract 9 points permanently from other characteristics, in any combination, adjusting any values calculated from those characteristics. If allegiance is used, add +1D8 allegiance to whatever force represents randomness and/or change.

### Liken Shape (4)

**Range:** Touch

The target assumes the appearance of another human or natural creature, taking on the new shape and corresponding attacks for the spell’s duration, but must retain their original SIZ as well as any applicable characteristics. Essentially, this spell allows a change of physical appearance and the ability to use physical characteristics.

**_For example,_** _a sorcerer becoming a canary will be improbably large, but has a correspondingly powerful beak attack (due to their human-sized damage modifier). A sorcerer using Liken Shape to transform into a bear will be quite small and weak, as far as bears go._

Your gamemaster should determine what aspects of a being’s abilities are natural and can be assumed with the spell, but those without a physical attack (claws, teeth) or with a magic origin (stony gaze, etc.) cannot be duplicated by the spell. This can vary by setting, such as high fantasy setting having dragon’s breath be magical and a gritty fantasy setting having dragon saliva be acidic and flammable.

The spell lets the sorcerer transform into another living being they have seen at least briefly. Based on their familiarity with the subject, subterfuge-related skills involving the disguise may be _Easy_. The spell is negated if the disguised character has physical contact from an actual creature of the species being imitated, or the original human being duplicated touches the character.

### Make Fast (1)

**Range:** Touch

This spell causes one specific item, hand-sized or smaller, to stick to one other thing. They cannot be separated by any normal means short of destruction of one or both items. This spell does not work on living or dead flesh, or on enchanted or otherwise magic items.

### Make Whole (3)

**Range:** Touch

This spell mends a broken item of size and bulk up to SIZ 50 (see **Object SIZ Examples**). The item should be comprised mostly of the same material or a limited number of materials (a brick wall works; a car is too complex). Your gamemaster should determine if an item is too complex or composed of too many types of material for the spell to work. The duration is longer than normal, lasting for 1D6 hours. Furthermore, if the sorcerer makes a successful Luck roll immediately after casting the spell, the effect is permanent, and the item is restored as if new. This spell does not work on living tissue or on supernatural creatures, magic items, or other types of magic enchantments. Undo Sorcery 3 ends this spell.

### Midnight (1)

**Range:** Sight

This spell creates an irregular cloud of absolute darkness in an area roughly that of a small room, about four meters per side. Normal vision does not work within this area until the spell ends. Otherwise, there is no other effect. If the caster wishes, they can move the darkness about by grasping it. Only the caster can move it in this manner. Undo Sorcery 1 removes this spell.

### Moonrise (1)

**Range:** Touch

This spell causes a ball of light a half-meter across to appear and float in the air, glowing enough to brightly light a room. If the caster wishes, they can grasp the ball of light and move it about. Only the caster can move it in this manner. Undo Sorcery 1 cancels this spell.

### Muddle (1)

**Range:** Sight

This spell disorients the target enough that they cannot cast spells or carry out coordinated plans if the sorcerer succeeds in a current power point vs. current power point resistance roll. However, the target can defend themselves and move by their own volition. If the caster succeeds in a _Difficult_ Luck roll, they can momentarily convince the target of something as if using the Fast Talk skill. The command or misinformation must be spoken aloud, and the target must be able to understand the language being spoken. The target can attempt to break it once each combat round if they can make a successful Idea roll (identifying the sorcerer’s influence). If the Idea roll is successful, the target can attempt a new current power point vs. current power point resistance roll to break free. If they are still under the spell’s influence, a new Idea roll must be made each round until free from the spell.

### Pox (1)

**Range:** Sight

This spell attacks the target’s power points, weakening them magically by overcoming the target with a successful current power point vs. current power point resistance roll. If successful, the target loses 1D6 power points; those lost points will regenerate normally. At 0 power points, a target immediately falls unconscious and cannot act. If the resistance roll is successful, the spell has no effect and the target’s power points are not lost.

### Refutation (1–4)

**Range:** Self

The sorcerer can defend themselves against the Undo Sorcery spell. Refutation can be cast in the same round as Undo Sorcery during the Powers phase and activates at the beginning of the next round. The sorcerer should make a resistance roll of Refutation against any levels of Undo Sorcery being cast. If Refutation wins, any power points spent in Undo Sorcery are lost and the spell has no effect. If Undo Sorcery wins, Refutation has no effect, its power points are lost, and Undo Sorcery works as if unaffected. If Undo Sorcery can attack more than one sorcery spell, choose the type of spell to negate (see the spell type groups), but the caster cannot specify the precise spell.

### Relentless Vitality (1–3)

**Range:** Touch

The target’s CON is increased by +3 points per level, thus adding 3, 6, or 9 to CON for the spell’s duration. Increasing CON temporarily also increases hit points and aids in fighting off certain poisons, diseases, etc., and increases the Stamina roll. This also affects fatigue points and characteristic bonuses, if used.

Damage taken while this spell is in effect is first removed from these extra hit points. It is impossible to die while Relentless Vitality is cast upon a target, but a target with 0 or negative hit points is unconscious and cannot act. Further attacks against the character continue to accrue negative hit points and may result in the loss of limbs or other major wounds. Once the spell’s duration ends, however, the character dies immediately if successful measures were not taken to restore their health to a positive hit point total. The effects of major wounds or lost limbs are still in effect, unless otherwise treated successfully.

When casting Relentless Vitality 3 for the maximum increase of +9 points, roll D100. On a result of 00, the sorcery becomes permanent, and those points are permanently added to the target’s CON. However, after that, the spell cannot affect them anymore, and they are unable to have it cast upon them again. They must now subtract 9 points permanently from other characteristics, in any combination, adjusting any values calculated from those characteristics. If allegiance is used, this adds +1D8 allegiance to whatever force represents randomness and/or change.

### Sorcery’s Sharp Flame (1–4)

**Range:** Touch

This spell may be cast upon a single impaling weapon, and only impaling weapons. It has no effect if cast upon another type of weapon. Each level increases the damage roll result by +1, up to the maximum rolled damage possible. The wielder’s damage modifier is rolled separately and is unaffected by this spell. This spell does not work for bows, slings, or guns, but does work on arrows, sling stones, and bullets. If the modified roll results in the maximum damage for the weapon, the tip of the weapon has become red-hot and can ignite a flammable target, causing 1D6 fire damage as a result (see **Fire and Heat**).

### Sorcerous Armor (1–4)

**Range:** Touch

Sorcerous Armor counts as magical armor added to the target’s total armor value (or the levels added to a random armor roll, up to the maximum value of the armor). It acts as normal armor in all other ways.

### Suppleness of the Serpent (1–3)

**Range:** Touch

The target’s DEX is increased by +3 points per level, thus adding 3, 6, or 9 points to DEX for the spell’s duration. Additionally, each level also increases the target’s Dodge by +6% temporarily. Increasing DEX also temporarily increases the Agility roll, and skill category modifiers, if used.

When casting Suppleness of the Serpent 3 for the maximum increase of +9 points, roll D100. On a result of 00, the effect becomes permanent, and those points are permanently added to the target’s DEX. However, after that, the spell cannot affect them anymore, and they are unable to have it cast upon them again. They must now permanently subtract 9 points from their other characteristics, in any combination, adjusting any values calculated from those characteristics. If allegiance is used, this adds +1D8 allegiance to whatever force represents randomness and/or change.

### Summon Demon (1)

**Range:** Self, Sight

This spell opens a channel of communication to the other planes (or hidden places within this plane, as appropriate), allowing communication with a demonic entity and the ability to bring it forth into the sorcerer’s home plane. Usually, demons have both a general name and a true name. The demon is summoned under the former; the latter is closely guarded, as it gives power over the demon (see _Chapter 11: Creatures_ for sample lesser and greater demons). The spell is relatively short but relaying the requirements of the demon to be summoned, and the negotiation with that entity takes 1D8 hours to do correctly. Summoning a demon costs 9 power points (in total), paid when the demon appears.

Alternately, at the end of the 1D8 hours of specifying the demon, the sorcerer may attempt to bind it into their service. Binding a demon costs the summoner 1 point of permanent POW, or 3 points of permanent POW to permanently bind the demon into an object. To attempt to bind a demon, roll the summoner’s POW (before the permanent POW is spent) vs. the demon’s POW in a resistance roll. If successful, the sorcerer now owns the demon.

When a demon is bound, a sorcerer can control its actions. If the roll fails, the demon escapes and will never again deal with that sorcerer. Typically, a sorcerer is limited to their INT in D6s of demon POW, counting against the sorcery spell limit.

**_For example,_** _a POW 3D8 demon counts as 3 levels of INT that a sorcerer cannot fill with sorcery spells._

Several types of bindings exist. A demon can be bound into the flesh, appearing as it does in its home plane; or it can be bound into an object or place. An ordinary binding lasts as long as a sorcerer lives or until they dismiss the demon. Permanently binding a demon creates a unique item or place with demonic powers and qualities that last long after a sorcerer dies, or until the object or place is destroyed. A bound demon responds only to its binder. If the demon is bound in an object, that object appears and functions as ordinary to anyone except the binder. If the binding object is broken, the demon dies.

Following are some general rules regarding demons:

- A bound demon counts against a sorcerer’s INT limit of memory, even if the demon is sent to another universe.
- A demon might be bound within an amulet, a ring, a wall of stone, a sword, etc. It retains only its abilities, its INT and POW, and other characteristics necessary to its abilities or skills. In all other aspects, the demon and the object into which it is bound are equivalent. The demon cannot move from the object until it is dismissed.
- Once bound, a demon surrenders its true name to its summoner.
- If the demon’s true name is known to the sorcerer, they can dismiss it, and then summon that same demon again to bind it once more. The demon is now a known quantity and its dice of POW do not count against the memory INT limit.
- A sorcerer that knows a demon’s true name can keep it bound, send it to its home plane, then call it back. This takes one combat round. In this way, a demon that is already bound and on another plane can reappear in a matter of seconds. Holding a demon in this way counts against the INT limit to memory. The demon appears through some focusing object touched by a sorcerer (summoner’s choice as to what the item is) and seems to emerge from it. The focusing object must be visibly marked with some sigil or item to specify its nature.

The sorcerer that binds a demon can dismiss it at any time. This eliminates the binding, takes 1D6 minutes, and costs no power points. The demon slowly evaporates in steam, smoke, and flame, and disappears. The binder retains knowledge of the demon’s true name, but the demon is removed from the INT limit to memory. A dismissed bound demon departs the object in which it has been bound. If it is later summoned again, it appears in its natural form and is not bound into the object. However, it can be bound again into the same object, place, or shape.

There are four ways to break an ordinary binding:

- The summoner can dismiss the demon.
- Killing the demon frees it.
- Killing the sorcerer who bound the demon.
- Learning the demon’s true name and successfully rebinding it.

A permanent binding cannot be destroyed except by destroying the object the demon is bound into. A bound demon that has been mistreated or whose needs have been neglected may be persuaded to reveal its true name to a second person. It will seek to be dismissed by that second person in exchange for some negotiated task. Since it may be immortal, a demon can afford patience. It will not casually give its true name to someone if it does not suspect that it will achieve its freedom.

#### Summoning a Demon

First, prepare a magical circle or specially defined area on the ground (an octagon, pentacle, etc.) to contain the demon to be summoned. Some demons require special items or preparations to be summoned. Knowing the spell gives access to this knowledge, but your gamemaster may require a roll of Knowledge (Occult) or Research to discover any special requirements. These may involve expensive or hard-to-find items, depending on the setting. Different demons require different costs of POW and/or power points to deal with and to bind—this varies by the type and strength of the demon.

Once these preparations are in place, the sorcerer can cast the Summon Demon spell, calling forth the exact demon they want. The demon appears within the next 1D8 hours. Summoning a powerful demon takes the sacrifice of many power points, more than most individuals have available, likely requiring additional power points from sources such as the Chain of Being or Brazier of Power spells. If there are not enough power points available to ‘pay’ for the demon, it disappears.

Whether the demon appears or not, the sorcerer loses the time and power points for the spell. When the demon arrives, the sorcerer can negotiate with it for one service or try to bind it to them so that it is always available.

A demon bound to the sorcerer’s will can appear in its true form. This is not recommended in some settings, but in other settings it may be useful to have a ferocious-looking demon on hand.

The demon can be bound within a piece of jewelry, a weapon, etc. However, an object-bound demon does not have full characteristics, which can be as advantageous as it is a disadvantage. When using the abilities of a demon bound into an item, it appears as if the sorcerer is the one with the power.

The sorcerer can also tell the demon to return to its own home plane, whispering its true name to compel obedience. Then it can be recalled whenever desired, as it is compelled to obey. This re-summons takes the demon one combat round. When it returns, it appears to erupt from an item of the sorcerer’s choice and is ready to be commanded.

### Summon Elemental (1)

**Range:** Self

This spell opens a channel of communication to various elemental planes of existence or allows speech to elemental spirits in the sorcerer’s home plane. Though the spell itself is relatively short, listing the requirements for the desired elemental requires 1D8 combat rounds. Additionally, the sorcerer must know the spell linked with the particular element desired—Bounty of the Sea, Flames of the Sun, Gift of the Earth, and Wings of the Sky. Knowing these spells is enough: they do not need to be cast at this time. After the Summon Elemental spell has been cast, the elemental arrives 1D6 combat rounds later, ready to carry out a single task required of it. Generally, elementals are more pleasant than demons, and not nearly as tricky or hostile. An elemental can be bound, though this may incur the wrath of any other elemental spirits. Sample types of four primary elementals are in **Summoned Creatures**, and more types can exist.

#### Invoking a God

Sorcery, with its emphasis on elementals and demon summoning, is often connected to the gods. In theory, anyone can call upon the gods and godlike entities and expect to be heard, since they are so mighty and since their abilities are so capacious. They can’t be summoned directly, because being summoned by a mortal is considered an insult. A god’s POW is likely to be far beyond what any mortal can command. A sorcerer may need to make successful rolls in Knowledge (Occult) or Knowledge (Religion) to know the exact rituals for a particular god or make a successful Research roll to discover the information in an appropriate library.

A sorcerer can respectfully beg a deity to appear once the proper rituals and preparations (if any) are completed. If they have any allegiance to that entity, a sorcerer has a 1% chance of getting a response. If a sorcerer is a champion of that god, they have a _Difficult_ Luck chance of a response. The gamemaster should determine what the response is. This may require successful rolls in skills such as Bargain, Fast Talk, or Persuade, and may involve an agreement to perform a service in return. When considering what the sorcerer can offer it of value, remember that while the god has vast powers and may read minds, it likely has need of mortal agents.

### Sureness (1–4)

**Range:** Touch

Each level increases the target’s Stealth skill by +20%, cumulatively, for the spell’s duration.

### Talons of the Beast (1–4)

**Range:** Touch

Each level increases the damage roll by +1 for a single weapon that augments an attacker’s hand (brass knuckles, cestus), or it increases the damage with Brawl or Grapple. Talons of the Beast does not increase the damage above the maximum. The wielder’s damage modifier is rolled separately and is unaffected by this spell. The spell needs to be cast on a single target and cannot be stacked—a target with this spell cast on them receives no bonus to any inappropriate hand weapons they wield. If also cast on an appropriate hand weapon the target is wielding, the bonus is not applied twice.

### Titan’s Strength (1–3)

**Range:** Touch

The target’s STR characteristic is increased by +3 points per level of the spell, adding 3, 6, or 9 points to STR for the duration. This increase can also temporarily increase the target’s damage modifier and Effort roll.

If a sorcerer casts Titan’s Strength 3 for the maximum increase of +9 points, roll D100. On a result of 00, the effects become permanent, and those points are permanently added to the target’s STR. However, after that, the spell does not affect the target anymore, and they become unable to have it cast upon them again. They must also subtract 9 points permanently from other characteristics, in any combination, adjusting any values calculated from those characteristics. If allegiance is used, this adds +1D8 allegiance to whatever force represents randomness and/or change.

### Unearthly Beauty (1–3)

**Range:** Touch

The target’s CHA characteristic is increased by +3 points per level, thus adding 3, 6, or 9 points to CHA for the spell’s duration. This increase can also temporarily increase the character’s distinctive features and Charm roll.

When Unearthly Beauty 3 is cast for the maximum increase of +9 points, roll D100. On a result of 00, the effects become permanent, and those points are permanently added to the target’s CHA. However, after that, the spell does not affect the target anymore, and it cannot be cast upon them again. They must also subtract 9 points permanently from other characteristics, in any combination, adjusting any values calculated from those characteristics. If allegiance is used, this adds +1D8 allegiance to whatever force represents randomness and/or change.

### Unbreakable Bulwark (1–4)

**Range:** Touch

This spell adds +1 per level to the armor protection value of shields and any objects used as shields. Each casting of the spell must be on a single shield or shield-like item, including items being used as improvised shields.

### Undo Sorcery (1–4)

**Range:** Touch

Each level of Undo Sorcery cast on another spell or spell-affected item negates one level of that spell. If the levels of Undo Sorcery are lower than the spell it is cast upon, the levels of Undo Sorcery are subtracted from the ongoing spell, weakening it but otherwise allowing it to remain in effect.

### Vermin’s Vision (1)

**Range:** Touch, Sight, etc.

The sorcerer can share in and control the vision of one rat, mouse, or similar vermin, chosen from within eyesight. If the target animal is lost from view, the spell continues for the rest of its duration, and can be extended with subsequent castings of the same spell. If no vermin are present when the spell is cast, it does not work. Your gamemaster should announce beforehand when there are no vermin within eyesight.

### Ward (3)

**Range:** Touch, Sight, etc.

As this spell is cast, the sorcerer must walk and define a line of 15 meters or less in length, or a circle of 15 meters or less in diameter. Afterwards, the sorcerer will become automatically aware the first time any enemy crosses the line or enters the circle. Once the spell is cast, it is ready to go but does not actually activate until the line is crossed. No further effort is required to maintain the spell, and for a little-traveled path or area, it might take years before anyone sets it off and alerts the caster. Spells like Witch Sight or other means of detecting sorcery or magic can identify a Ward. Undo Sorcery 3 eliminates a Ward.

### Wings of the Sky (4)

**Range:** Sight

This spell causes a turbulent mass of air to suddenly appear in a small room or small open area for the duration of the spell. It has a wind force of STR 2D6+6; those caught in it must succeed in a _Difficult_ Agility roll to remain standing. This spell must be known before air elementals can be summoned or invoked using the Summon Elemental spell. Undo Sorcery 4 can negate this spell, but any air that has arrived will remain. Fires of the Sun cancels this spell if cast upon the same area.

### Wisdom of the Sage (1–3)

**Range:** Touch, Sight, etc.

The target’s current INT is increased by +3 points per level, as well as modifying any relevant characteristic rolls or other applicable attributes.

When Wisdom of the Sage 3 is cast for the maximum increase of +9 points, roll D100. On a result of 00, the effect becomes permanent, and those points are permanently added to the target’s INT. However, after that, the spell does not affect the target anymore, and it cannot be cast on them again. The target must permanently subtract 9 points from their other characteristics, in any combination, adjusting any values calculated from those characteristics. If allegiance is used, such a dramatic rearrangement is worth 1D8 points to whichever force celebrates randomness and/or change.

### Witch Sight (3)

**Range:** Self, 100 meters of sight

The sorcerer learns the approximate strength of a target’s POW compared to theirs, defined as: much stronger (more than double the caster’s pow); stronger (up to double); equal (within one or two points); weaker (down to half); or much weaker (less than half).

The spell can be canceled by or shielded against by Undo Sorcery. While in effect, the sorcerer can see emanations from any invisible beings, elementals, and spirits, and can follow or trace where sorcerous entities have recently passed. Your gamemaster should determine if this can detect characters made invisible through technology or another type of power (magic, psychic abilities, mutations, superpowers, etc.). The spell may also detect beings of extremely high allegiance to a particular force.

Witch Sight is almost always used in summoning demons or elementals. If using the Summon Demon spell with Witch Sight cast, your gamemaster should roll the number of D8s specified for the demon’s POW and announce that number. Without using Witch Sight, a sorcerer risks summoning an unbindable demon.

Similarly, if an artifact or magic item has an intelligent being like a demon or an elemental bound within it, Witch Sight allows the possessor to mentally converse with the being in the object, providing it is able and willing. This process takes a full day of studying the artifact and requires a successful roll of POW×l or less but does not require Witch Sight to be cast until the actual moment when communication is desired. Your gamemaster should announce whether the POW×1 roll is successful. They do not need to announce ahead of time if the being inside the artifact is able to or willing to communicate, or if a particular language skill is required to communicate successfully.

## Superpowers

Superpowers are extraordinary abilities granted by various causes: radioactivity, freak accidents, experimentation, training, genetic legacies, super-science, etc. Characters with superpowers are described as **superheroes**, but these powers are not limited to people in tights and capes. These abilities can be used for aliens, robots, demigods, misunderstood monsters, anime heroes, mystic knights, or other incredible beings.

### Superpower Origins

How did the superhero get these powers? Are superpowers common in the setting, or a one-in-a-million occurrence? Are superpowers intrinsic, or do they depend on some item or substance? Ask your gamemaster what context powers have in the setting. Does society worship and respect superheroes, or are they feared, hunted, or even outlawed?

When devising a character with superpowers, consider what sorts of superpowers they have. Do all your characters have themed powers, based on a unifying concept (an element, a color, an origin, etc.), or are you all distinct? How does your character view these superpowers? Do they help in normal life, or prevent it entirely?

Your gamemaster should be working with the players, providing answers, and helping shape your character’s creation process. Not all these questions need to be explored fully, or even answered at all, but they should help you devise a good background for your character’s powers and their source, as well as helping set the stage for how powers fit into the game setting.

### How Superpowers Work

Superpowers are measured in **levels**. Each level costs a different amount of POW and represents increased effectiveness. Superpowers are often based on characteristics (STR, DEX, SIZ, INT, etc.), or the power’s level itself is the relevant factor. Some powers must have their level exceed a characteristic to succeed, while others use resistance rolls pitting the related characteristic against an opposed characteristic.

Superpowers that need to be directed at the target either use Brawl, Throw, or Projection. Other powers that are less straightforward operate similarly, often using an existing skill in a way not possible for normal humans. A few powers are unique, either having an automatic effect once successfully used, or adding to existing skills and characteristics.

### Starting Superpowers: the Character Point Budget

After determining initial characteristics, determine your character’s initial character point budget, based on your character’s as-of-yet-unmodified characteristics (STR, DEX, INT, etc.), as follows:

- **Normal:** Highest characteristic ×½ (round up).
- **Heroic:** Unmodified.
- **Epic:** Highest characteristic ×2.
- **Superhuman:** Add all characteristics together.

Alternatively, your gamemaster may simply determine that initial character point budget is something like 10 for a lower-powered game, 20 for a heroic game, 35 for an epic game, and 75+ for the superhuman power level. This can be modified through character failings or power modifiers (see the relevant sections below).

### Buying Powers

Examine the list of powers, and their descriptions. Power titles are generic—rename them as desired, with your gamemaster’s approval. Consider what you want your character to be able to do and try to find the most direct superpower or combination of superpowers to achieve that goal. Your gamemaster can help you clarify what superpower does what, and what higher levels of each superpower can do.

The descriptions should help you determine how many levels of each desired superpower you’ll need. Some superpowers may have special requirements based on your characteristics—pay special attention to these. Determine how strong you would like the superpower to be and purchase accordingly.

**Extra Energy is probably the most useful superpower** if you want your character to use superpowers more than a few times a day. Buy as many levels of it as you need.

### Character Failings and Power Modifiers

After choosing your basic superpowers and determining how much of your budget they cost, you may want to increase your available points. There are two ways of doing this: character failings and power modifiers. Each has a different purpose, but both serve to personalize your superhero character. Character failings are problems your character faces, inherent flaws in their background or social existence, while power modifiers alter or limit a specific power.

### Character Failings

A character failing is a cultural, physical, or social disadvantage your character suffers. This causes them problems in their daily life, but in return, extra points go into the character point budget to spend as desired. Your character can only take up to ½ their starting character point budget (round up) in character failings. This limit prevents your character from becoming unplayable—overburdened and hindered by an overabundance of disadvantages. If, however, for some reason you have taken additional character failings beyond the limit, your character can still suffer the in-game penalties but receives no additional points.

See the **Benefits From Character Failings Table** (below) for sample character failings. Your gamemaster may add more to this list, or may introduce new and unique character failings, with the gamemaster’s approval.

#### Benefits From Character Failings Table

|Character Failing|Character Point Budget Reward|
|---|---|
|Super identity must be activated to use powers.|+1 point|
|Super identity must be activated in an obvious and preventable manner, such as an activating word or gesture, a visible item or outfit, etc.|+1 point|
|Super identity is always on, making normal life difficult or impossible.|+5 points|
|Physical frailty, impairment, or disability, or a debilitating medical condition. Determine skill or characteristic penalties based on major wounds.|+1 point for partial problem, +3 points for constant problem|
|Psycho-social frailty, a major phobia, social disorder, or some other compulsion.|+1 point each (+3 points maximum, higher with gamemaster’s approval)|
|Bad or self-destructive habit, vice, etc.|+1–3 points, depending on severity|
|Dependent family member, significant other, friend, or ally that requires regular attention and is potentially endangered due to the relationship.|+1 points for infrequent minor involvement, +3 points for frequent significant involvement|
|Responsibility to an organization or group that influences or restricts freedom and requires regular attention.|+1 point for infrequent minor involvement, +3 points for frequent significant involvement|
|Member of socially disadvantaged group or other organization that regularly causes inconvenience.|+1 point for infrequent minor inconvenience, +3 points for frequent significant inconvenience|
|Actively hunted by some individual or organization for legitimate or illegitimate reasons.|+1–3 points, depending on size and power of group, level of threat it presents, and frequency of appearance|
|Special weakness to some substance or class of item that inflicts damage when exposed to it within 15 meters.||
|The character cannot have a power providing resistance to this item or condition. Choose damage and rarity of substance below:|1D6 points damage per combat round|
|+1 point|2D6 points damage per combat round|
|+2 points|Each additional +D6 per combat round|
|+1 additional point per additional D6 damage||
|Item is very common (fire, sunlight, water, steel, etc.)|+2 points|
|Other type of power than the one the character has (magic vs. super, etc.), if used|+2 points|
|1D6 points temporary characteristic point loss per combat round while in 5-meter range|+1 point per D6 characteristic reduction|
|Item is very rare (meteoric rocks, rare metals, special radiation, etc.)|–1 point to above modifier|
|Special added damage from certain attacks (cold, fire, sound, radiation, etc.) taken per attack. Choose added damage below:|+1D6 damage|
|+2D6 damage|+2 points|
|+3D6 damage|+3 points|
|+4D6 damage|+4 points|
|Each additional +D6|+1 additional point per additional D6|

### Power Modifiers

Power modifiers are worth extra character point budget points by altering a superpower when they make it less effective in some way, voluntarily limiting some aspect of its use. By assigning power modifiers to specific superpowers, you can gain more points to buy new superpowers, or buy more levels in superpowers. Not all power modifiers are limitations, however. Some modifiers are positive and make powers more expensive.

See the **Power Modifiers Table** for more information. Each reward is associated with a single superpower: a modifier that affects all your character’s superpowers should be applied separately to each power. Not every power modifier is appropriate for every power, and your gamemaster may veto any unlikely or inappropriate combination.

No superpower can earn more character point budget points than ½ its initial cost (round down) through power modifiers.

#### Power Modifiers Table

|Modifier|Budget Reward|
|---|---|
|Power effective only under certain conditions (underwater, night, timed, etc.)|+5 points|
|Power ineffective against certain objects:||
|Common items (color, plant, mineral, etc.)|+1 point per level|
|Other power sets (magic vs. super, etc.)|+1 point per level|
|Uncommon items (rare element, special radiation, etc.)|+1 point per level|
|Power has a limited number of uses per day (minimum 1)|+ (10 minus number of uses)|
|Power has different attributes than described:||
|Ranged power is touch only|+1 point per level|
|Single target power has range (15 meters)|Doubles base cost of power|
|Power costs power points or fatigue points to use where normally it has no cost|+1 point per power point or fatigue point cost|
|Power point cost is doubled|+1 point per power point cost per round|
|Power point cost is halved|Doubles base cost of power|
|Power which usually only costs power points to activate now costs every combat round|+1 point per power point cost per round|
|Power which normally has no power point cost now costs power points each combat round|+1 point per power point cost per round|
|Power costs power points + fatigue points, or power points + sanity points|+1 point per power point cost per round|
|Energy from power is dissipated involuntarily:||
|Under special circumstances (rainstorm, underground, in presence of holy items, etc.)|+ 1 point per power point cost per round|
|Under common circumstances (daylight, moonlight, etc.)|+ 2 point per power point cost per round|
|Power cannot improve through experience or any other means|+1 point per level|

### Other Disadvantages

If you would like to assign an additional disadvantage to your character in return for additional points, your gamemaster should examine the disadvantage and determine if it is worthwhile for a character point budget bonus, and if so, how many points it is worth. Is it seriously limiting or merely inconvenient? Will it cause your character real trouble? How much trouble? Will the disadvantage cause the other characters difficulty?

Your gamemaster should be willing to negotiate with you for new suggested disadvantages. Similarly, you should accept it if your gamemaster says no. If so, come up with an alternative solution. One option is to put the disadvantage ‘on hold’ and see if it can be worked in, with the points awarded when it becomes effective. Note the disadvantage initially, but it is not significant until your gamemaster allows it. At that time, your character gets the extra character budget points.

### Allocating Superpower Levels

All superpowers have effects defined in levels, bought with the character point budget. A single level gives the base damage, range, and other attributes, and any other effects listed, and additional levels of a power will increase one or more of these attributes, as described. **Power Modifiers** allow further customization of powers. Usually, one level of a damage-dealing power means it does 1D6 damage, two levels deal 2D6 damage, three levels 3D6, etc. Only a few powers break this paradigm.

### Unused Budget Points

If you have any remaining points of your character point budget, they are not lost and are kept in a bank of points to use when improving your character (see **Character Point Budget Awards**, below). You can store any number of points in your character point budget, though it can never go below 0. If a new level in a power costs more than you have in your character point budget, either take (or increase) a character failing or power modifier, or wait until you have enough points.

### Improving Superpowers

Superpowers are handled differently than skill and characteristic experience. They do not improve as normal skills (the Projection skill is an exception) and follow different methods of advancement.

- **Characteristic Improvement:** When experience is determined, any successful characteristic improvement roll can be assigned to any other characteristic that can be improved by experience instead, in full or divided between multiple characteristics. See **Increasing Characteristics** for more information. These characteristic points can also be turned into an equivalent amount of character power budget points (see **Super Characteristic**) instead of being used to improve a characteristic.
- **Training:** Your character can spend the time between adventures training in a power (assuming a suitable trainer or facility is available). The trainer must have the desired power at a higher level or some equivalent, appropriate knowledge. See **Increasing Characteristics**. At the conclusion of the training, roll as if a characteristic of your choice is being improved (usually 1D3–1), and turn those points into character power budget points, as above.
- **Character Point Budget Awards:** Your gamemaster may choose instead to reward character power budget points at the completion of an adventure or resolution of a major plot. Suggested amounts are from 1 or 2 points for a minor or average adventure, to 5 to 10 points for a major victory, adjusted by the game’s power level. These points can be spent immediately or stored for later use.
- **New Character Failings or Power Modifiers:** You can also gain additional points by taking on new character failings or power modifiers, often driven by events in the game or by emergent threats. Your gamemaster may limit the maximum number of points gained this way, or approve any elements based on outside forces (nonplayer characters, organizations, etc.).

Other methods of adding budget points may be suggested by your gamemaster, as appropriate.

### Gaining New Superpowers

You may wish to add a new superpower to your character after they are created. This uses the same method of improving an existing power (above). The gamemaster may require you to justify the new power, such as its manifestation based on an event in the game or a particular adventure. It might be a side effect of an existing power, or latent and now emerged. Alternatively, your character may need to find an instructor with the power, or some other means to learn it.

Your gamemaster may allow you to completely redo your character’s powers, perhaps due to an incident causing their evolution into an almost new character. This might involve a new identity, a new costume, or some other radical reimagining of the character. In this case, you should discuss how you and your gamemaster want to handle it.

### Losing Superpowers

Sometimes, you or your gamemaster may wish to permanently strip your character of a power. This should be extremely rare and caused by extraordinary circumstances, and generally only with your tacit approval. When this happens, the points spent on the powers are returned to your character’s character point budget, and they must lose any character failings or power modifiers that depended upon the power(s). Depending on the reason and method the powers are lost, you may spend them later for new powers.

### Losing Character Failings or Power Modifiers

You may spend budget points to ‘buy off’ any character failings or power modifiers you do not wish your character to have any more. This should only be done with your gamemaster’s permission, especially where this might affect elements in the campaign.

Similarly, if your character is unlikely to suffer the conditions of a particular character failing or power modifier, your gamemaster may require you to make up the deficit in character point budget points by taking on a new and equal character failing or power modifier or remove those points from any surplus in your current character point budget (perhaps subtracting them from future rewards).

### The Projection Skill (option)

This optional skill is used by superheroes to ‘fire’ or direct a superpower at a target. It can be increased in character generation if the character has superpowers and is subject to the power level limitations. If using skill category modifiers, the Physical skill bonus applies to Projection.

#### Projection

**Base Chance:** DEX×2 Category: Physical

Use this skill to direct powered attacks at a target using powers such as Energy Projection, Snare Projection, and others. Choose how your character emits this power—hands, eyes, or from a device. When the power is used, on a fumble the power points are lost, consult the **Missile Weapon Fumbles Table** for additional guidance (interpreted as necessary). Failure goes wide of the target: roll 1D4 to see if the projection falls in front, behind, to the right, or to the left of the target. Make a Luck roll to avoid collateral damage such as striking an innocent bystander, an ally, or causing structural damage. Success strikes the target, and a special success hits it with additional precision and may do additional damage or have an increased effect. A critical, as always, is perfectly executed to maximum effect. If a combat power, use the guidance for special and critical successes.

**System Notes:** Your character’s damage modifier is never included in any projected superpower. Line of sight is required for Projection. Modifiers that apply to missile or ranged attacks also apply. Projection may be used for **Aimed Attacks**. Projection can be dodged, like a missile weapon, though the Dodge roll may be _Difficult_ (see **Dodging Missile Weapons**).

### Energy Types

Many superpowers refer to a wide range of energy types, classified in terms that may or may not be suitable for different settings. Many make no sense scientifically and violate basic physical laws and are best suited for fantastic or superhero settings.

Energy types are classified specifically for powers—a character with Energy Control (Heat) cannot also use Energy Control (Cold). Similarly, rather than working against all energy types, Absorption has a specific type of energy it is proof against.

When purchasing superpowers, it is advised to purchase levels of the same superpower but focused on different energy types, so Absorption can work against heat and cold attacks if it is purchased once for each energy type. These energy types also provide guidelines for when they can potentially interact with the environment and equipment. _Chapter 8: Equipment_ covers equipment in more detail with examples of gear that replicates certain powers. For example, a thermal suit may provide Resistance (Cold) 1 but provides no protection against other damage types such as gravity, darkness, kinetic, psychic, or electricity.

All major energy types are summarized below for reference, as well as any opposing energy type.

- **Cold:** Freezing temperatures, from radiant cold to snow, hail, or ice. The opposite is heat.
- **Darkness:** This represents darkness as an element that violates the laws of physics. Darkness energy behaves almost exactly like light does—it can form beams or rays, and can fill an area, ridding it of light. Darkness and light are opposites.
- **Electric:** Any galvanic current, whether lightning or regular household current. Most energy storage devices (batteries) store electricity.
- **Gravity:** Both the force and the ability to manipulate it. This can be an alteration of normal gravity or generating it where it barely exists, such as in deep space.
- **Heat:** Radiant heat up to intense fire that becomes plasma. Heat and cold are opposites.
- **Kinetic:** Any physical force, from a punch, gunshot, sword-blow, to the impact of a fall. Kinetic energy is the most common, as it is the easiest to generate.
- **Light:** Whether ambient or laser, this covers all light. It also extends into ultraviolet and infrared spectrums. Light and darkness are opposites.
- **Magnetic:** The force that attracts or repulses metallic objects or substances.
- **Radiation:** A general term for any atomic, nuclear, fusion, beta, gamma, microwave, cosmic, or other type of radiation.
- **Sound:** Sound waves, from inaudible to deafening. Though the Silence power cancels sound energy, it is not an energy type in and of itself.
- **Wind:** Focused air currents strong enough to hinder or harm a target.

Your setting may have additional energy types. Use the above descriptions as guidelines.

### Absorption, Armor, Protection, and Resistance

These four superpowers work differently but all serve the same purpose: keeping your character from taking damage. These guidelines illustrate their differences and how they work in conjunction with one another. They are presented in the order they come into play.

- **Resistance** is all-or-nothing, like parrying with a shield. If it resists the attack, there is no effect. If the attack gets past the Resistance, it strikes your character with full effect.
- **Protection** reduces the effects of an attack. Like sunscreen, it limits the amount of solar radiation getting through to your skin, but it isn’t the same as staying in the shade, and certainly won’t help against skin cancer.
- **Armor** protects like physical armor. If your character is hit by an attack, it reduces the amount of damage taken.
- **Absorption** soaks up damage taken from an attack and turns it into energy your character can use.

Where more than one of these four superpowers is in effect, handle them in reverse alphabetical order (as above). First, Resistance determines whether the power works at all, Protection lowers the levels of the power if it gets through, Armor reduces the damage inflicted on your character, and Absorption soaks up any remaining points and turns them into power points.

### Powers and Success Levels

Unlike skills, the use of superpowers is always clear to interpret. Many have effects that are either ‘on’ or ‘off’, with no difference between a critical, special, or normal success. The guidelines below can help your gamemaster when deciding superpower skill roll outcomes.

- **Fumble:** The power points are lost, and the character cannot use this superpower for one combat round after the round of the fumble. If the superpower usually does damage, make a Luck roll. Success means the power just doesn’t work. Failure means that the superpower struck an unintended target (innocent bystander, valuable equipment, etc.) causing collateral damage and potentially complicating the situation. Some superpowers may have additional consequences for fumbles.
- **Failure:** The power either succeeds and misses or it doesn’t work at all. It doesn’t cause any harm or complications. The power points are lost.
- **Success:** The superpower works as described and the power points are spent.
- **Special:** The superpower works with increased effectiveness. If a special success damage type (crushing, entangling, impaling, knockback, or slashing) is appropriate, incorporate it into the result. At your gamemaster’s discretion, another aspect of the power (range, influence, etc.) may have doubled effect. Alternatively, if the power involves a resistance roll, increase the superpower’s level by half again or the characteristic (round up) for the resistance roll.
- **Critical:** The superpower works perfectly. If it usually causes damage, it ignores any armor the target possesses and has the effect of a special success (above). If it does not normally cause damage, your gamemaster should determine an appropriate aspect (or aspects) of the superpower and double its effectiveness. Alternatively, if a resistance roll is required, double the superpower’s level or the relevant characteristic for the resistance roll.

These outcomes may require additional interpretation, or your gamemaster is free to simply use the results of dice rolls without any adjustment for degrees of success.

Each power in this section is described in the following manner:

- **Base Range:** ‘Self’ is internal to the superhero, ‘Touch’ indicates close range, and ‘15 meters’ is the default range. Many ranged superpowers gain additional range with additional levels.
- **Duration:** ‘Instantaneous’ superpowers work immediately on the DEX (or strike) rank they are used. Other superpowers work for one or more combat rounds, from the moment they’re used until the end of the specified combat round. ‘Always on’ means that the power is active until deactivated. These powers automatically reactivate whenever desired.
- **Power Cost:** The cost per level.
- **Power Point Cost:** The number of power points the superpower costs to activate and/or keep active.

A description of the superpower and its effects. This description refers to other game systems the superpower interacts with or relies upon.

As noted prior, these powers have generic titles: you may change the name of the power to match your character concept, with your gamemaster’s permission. If so, note the original title of the power for ease of reference.

### Absorption

**Base Range:** Self

**Duration:** Always on

**Character Point Cost:** 3 per level

**Power Point Cost:** None

Each level absorbs 1 point of damage from one type of energy (see **Energy Types**) and stores it in the superhero’s own power point supply or into some ‘battery’ or device. The power point capacity of the superhero and/or battery must have enough space for the power points, or the excess damage affects the superhero.

When selecting this power, define the type of energy it absorbs (see **Energy Types**) such as ‘Absorption (Electric)’. The energy type must be something that can cause damage under normal circumstances and not something normally harmless. The damage absorbed is removed from actual damage taken—any armor (or the Armor superpower) reduces the damage before Absorption can affect it.

Energy absorbed with this power cannot be taken out of an external battery and shifted into a superhero’s normal power points, or vice versa, unless the battery also has Absorption. For a weak energy type that could conceivably cause damage over the long term, such as a roaring campfire for heat, generally a weak source generates1 point of energy per combat round, a mild source generates of 1D6 points, a moderate source 2D6, a strong one 3D6, etc.

### Adaptation

**Base Range:** Self

**Duration:** 1 full turn

**Character Point Cost:** 3 per level

**Power Point Cost:** 1 power point per SIZ to activate, then 1 power point per full turn

Each level allows survival in one other environment, such as underwater or a vacuum. At your gamemaster’s discretion, Adaptation against one environment may offer limited or full protection against related environments (survival in a vacuum might offer some protection against intense cold). Gear is usually protected from the adverse effects of the environment, if appropriate. Write it like this: ‘Adaptation (Environment)’.

For each level of this power, pick one environment from the following list:

- Cold
- Corrosive
- Heat
- High Gravity
- High Pressure
- Low Gravity
- Radiation
- Underwater
- Vacuum

The superpower allows the character to live comfortably in these extreme environments but does not offer special defense against attacks using these conditions, such as with Energy Control, though the gamemaster may rule that an appropriate Adaptation provides half its levels in protection. Otherwise, use the Armor, Protection, or Resistance superpowers.

Adverse environments are described in _Chapter 7: Spot Rules_. If uncertain, assume that a minor hazardous environment inflicts 1 hit point of damage per combat round, a mildly harmful one causes 1D6 hit points damage per combat round, a moderately hazardous one 2D6 hit points per round, extremely dangerous 3D6, etc. Some environments may require a combination of two or more types of Adaptation to survive, such as underwater (underwater, high pressure), outer space (cold, radiation, vacuum), or on the sun (heat, radiation, high gravity).

### Alternate Form

**Base Range:** Self

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Character Point Cost:** 20 per form

**Power Point Cost:** None

Each level provides one alternate body to switch into, usually one more suitable for adventure. This body replaces the character’s natural body and can represent transformation (such as a werewolf) or an outright switching of places (a superhero body). This transformation is instantaneous or nearly so, being completed within a single combat round.

Ideally, when this power is created, make a copy of your character sheet before superpowers are purchased. This is the template for the alternate form. Follow these steps:

- Powers for the new form(s) come out of the character point budget if they are not intrinsic to the new shape. The new form(s) can have any applicable character failings or power modifiers. Your gamemaster may also allow a separate character point budget unique to the alternate form, which you can add to from your own budget.
- For supernatural forms, work with your gamemaster to determine any inherent powers the new form comes with, and what might need to be purchased.
- If the new form resembles an animal, consult _Chapter 11: Creatures_ for appropriate powers or abilities. Copy a sample animal’s writeup for convenience. Natural attributes such as claws, bite, or thick fur armor are part of the shape and do not need to be paid for.
- Any unmodified characteristics or skills of the new form(s) are assumed to be identical to the original character. However, the new form makes its own set of experience checks, which do not affect the original’s characteristics or skills.
- Determine any special gear or garments the alternate form(s) should arrive equipped with.
- Determine what happens to the original or alternate form(s) when it’s not in use.
- Useful things to consider from a narrative point are whether the alternate form has consciousness while away, or if it is unaware of the passage of time and events concerning the current form? Do the forms differ in personality and goals, or are they essentially the same character? Do they even know about each other?

Alternate Form costs nothing to use. When rendered unconscious in the alternate form, the character reverts to their original body. The switch back from the alternate form gives your character the lower of each form’s power points, sanity points, hit points, fatigue points, etc. Furthermore, a debilitating state such as a curse, insanity, etc., remains in either form, if applicable.

Work with your gamemaster to decide whether death in one form means death in both, or if one form can survive the loss of the other and any detrimental effects. This may cause a sanity point loss (depending on circumstances) or inflict shock, requiring a _Difficult_ Luck roll to overcome immediately, failure causing stunning for 1D6 combat rounds or longer.

This power is best employed with the various power modifiers and character failings involving partial access to powers. At your gamemaster’s discretion, one of those may be mandatory with the purchase of the Alternate Form power.

### Armor

**Base Range:** Self

**Duration:** Always on, or 10 combat rounds

**Character Point Cost:** 1 per level per type

**Power Point Cost:** None, or 1 per level per 10 combat rounds

Each level provides 1 point of armor against a particular type of attack. This protection can be tough skin, hardened scales, steel plate, etc. When purchased, the energy type it is intended to protect against must be chosen from **Energy Types** and listed like ‘Armor (Kinetic)’. Purchasing Armor against multiple types of damage equally costs the level multiplied by the number of energy types it protects against.

However, all types of Armor do not need to be at the same level: a superhero can have ‘Armor (Kinetic) 2’ and ‘Armor (Heat) 5’. If so, the power should be listed separately. While in effect, Armor is proof against all protected types of damage, in any number of attacks per round, and does not have to be consciously directed.

Armor that serves as a force field needing power points to activate costs ½ the normal price (round up). The power point cost is 1 power point per level to activate the force field. It lasts for 10 combat rounds and can automatically renew itself for 1 power point per level.

### Barrier

**Base Range:** 15 meters

**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Character Point Cost:** 3 per level

**Power Point Cost:** 3 per level

This brings a wall-like obstruction out of the ground or forms it of available material. Alternatively, the barrier can be formed of an energy type generated by another power—though that power must be used beforehand. The barrier is usually placed to protect against attacks or attackers, though it can appear anywhere within range. Each level provides a barrier 1 meter thick, 1 meter wide, and 1 meter high. These square meters can be distributed as you wish along the dimensions of width, height, and length, or spread thinner. This barrier can be shaped in any simple form: a straight or curved wall, half-sphere, etc. Whatever its configuration, the base must rest on the ground. When creating the barrier, decide how large it will be, using height × thickness × length in meters as to determine levels and power point cost. Any extra multiples can be distributed as desired anywhere along the length of the barrier.

**_For example,_** _Barrier 9 can create a barrier 1 meter thick, 3 meters high, and 3 meters long (1×3×3=9)._

A barrier cannot be created in the air to drop onto an opponent, though a tall thin barrier could be toppled onto a foe. If so used, it does 1D6 points of damage per 1-meter section that strikes an opponent (if they do not dodge successfully). A barrier composed of an energy type (see **Energy Types**) may have additional properties, such as a barrier of fire causing incendiary damage to those who try to bypass it.

Regardless of its substance, a barrier has 30 hit points. Each additional meter of material added to its thickness adds 30 hit points to its total in that spot. Most human-sized opponents need only to destroy one or two 1-meter segments to move through it. If desired, more ‘authentic’ hit point or armor values for the barrier’s substance can be found in **Armor Value of Substances**. When the power ends, the barrier dissolves, melts, retracts, or gradually disappears in an appropriate manner, unless formed of a substance that would normally remain.

### Defense

**Base Range:** Self

**Duration:** Always on

**Character Point Cost:** 1 per level

**Power Point Cost:** None

This power modifies all attacks made against the character by –5% per level. This does not increase with experience, but stacks with other factors that reduce an attacker’s chance to hit the character, such as Unarmed Combat. The levels are limited to the character’s DEX+POW, though if attack skill ratings above 100% are allowed, ignore this restriction.

### Density Control

**Base Range:** Self

**Duration:** Variable

**Character Point Cost:** 1 per level

**Power Point Cost:** 1 per level per combat round

This power lets the character increase or decrease their density by ±1 SIZ per level (for this power, SIZ is weight and not actual physical mass). Density Control allows both an increase and decrease in density, unlike Size Change. and it does not confer Intangibility.

Increased density increases the damage modifier and hit points, though it lowers movement rate by 2 meters per round. Additionally, every 10 levels (round down) of Density Control adds +1 armor vs. kinetic-based attacks (punches, falls, gunshots, etc.).

Decreased density lowers the character’s SIZ (in weight) and modifies the damage modifier and hit points. At SIZ 0, a human-sized character can fly by gliding on air currents, moving at the speed of the wind. Decreased density does not affect normal movement. Every level of decreased density modifies armor value by –1, to a minimum of 0. Decreased density also lowers the damage from falls by –1 point per level.

See **Object SIZ Examples** for information on weight relating to an item’s SIZ. At your gamemaster’s discretion, this power applies to any equipment worn (such as armor).

### Diminish/Enhance Characteristic

**Base Range:** Touch

**Duration:** 10 combat rounds

**Character Point Cost:** 5 per level

**Power Point Cost:** 1 per level

This power decreases or increases a characteristic (STR, CON, DEX, INT, POW, or CHA) by 1D6 per level. If the target is unwilling, overcome them with a current power point vs. current power point resistance roll. No roll is required for a willing target. The effects are temporary (except for hit points, see below), and affect the target’s damage modifier, characteristic rolls, DEX rank, power points, or fatigue points as appropriate. Characteristics enhanced go above the normal maximum allowed for rolled characteristics (usually 21 for humans). If the characteristic modifiers are used, those modifiers are affected.

A characteristic reduced to 0 or lower is considered as 0, and the target can do nothing relating to that characteristic.

**_For example,_** _having a DEX 0 means the target cannot move, while STR 0 means that they cannot lift anything._

Anyone reduced to CON 0 is comatose for the power’s duration, and a target with 0 hit points is dead. When the superpower is over, the characteristic is restored to its normal value, and any secondary attributes are no longer affected. The target’s hit points are restored to their previous value or the current value, whichever is lower. Similarly, power points and fatigue points are restored to the lower of their previous or current value.

### Drain

**Base Range:** Touch

**Duration:** 1 combat round

**Character Point Cost:** 10 per level for hit points, 5 per level for others (fatigue, power, or sanity points)

**Power Point Cost:** 1 per level per combat round

Drain allows the character to drain hit points, power points, fatigue points, or sanity points from another character and add those to their own points. When this power is purchased, designate which resource it drains, such as ‘Drain (Hit Points)’. Draining more than one resource requires taking the power multiple times.

The method of draining can vary widely (grab, bite, handshake, etc.) but must involve physical contact for at least one full combat round. This may require a successful Grapple attempt in combat, or Agility roll if outside of combat. No roll is required for an immobile or willing target, and against an unaware target the roll is _Easy_. To continue to drain a target on successive rounds, the requisite maneuver (Grapple, etc.) must be rolled again. Once contact has been established, defeat the target in a current power point vs. current power point resistance roll. Failure means it has no effect and the target can attempt to break free. For a willing target, no resistance roll is required. If successful, the drained resource is transferred from the target to the character in the Powers phase of the next round. The rate of this transfer is 1D6 points per level per combat round, with additional levels draining more points (level 2 drains 2D6, level 3 drains 3D6, etc.).

- **Hit Points:** While being drained, the target must make a successful Effort roll to act. If the target’s hit point total reaches 1 or 2, they fall unconscious. If their hit point total reaches 0, they die at the beginning of the next combat round (see Hit Points). Any hit points above the drainer’s normal hit point total are lost. Drained hit points return normally.
- **Power Points:** While being drained, the target must make a successful Luck roll to act. If the target’s power point total reaches 0, they fall unconscious. The drainer can store power points above and beyond their normal power point maximum: these points are temporary. They are not recovered when spent and dissipate when the normal power point total is restored. The maximum for ‘extra’ power points is equal to the drainer’s power point maximum plus the levels of Drain. Drained power points return normally.
- **Fatigue Points:** Fatigue points are optional, so if they are not used, this choice cannot be taken. While being drained, the target must make a successful Stamina roll to act. If the target’s fatigue point total goes below 0, they suffer penalties (see **Fatigue**). Any fatigue points above the drainer’s normal fatigue point total are lost. Drained fatigue points return normally.
- **Sanity Points:** While being drained, the target must make a successful Idea roll to act. A target that goes below 0 sanity points is now hopelessly insane and must become a nonplayer character (if they are not already so). See the rules for sanity point loss. The drainer can transfer as many sanity points as desired up to the maximum allowed (see **Maximum Sanity**). Drained sanity points do not return.

The drainer does not have to transfer the points drained to themselves: they can instead allow them to dissipate, gaining no benefit. A character that drains multiple resources (hit points and power points, for example) can attempt to do so in the same contact but must make a separate resistance roll for each resource drained. Each additional resource type takes an additional combat round: targets cannot be drained of multiple resources simultaneously, though the drainer can alternate turn-by-turn.

This superpower is the opposite of Transfer.

### Energy Control

**Base Range:** 15 meters, or Touch (when attacking)

**Duration:** 1 combat round

**Character Point Cost:** 3 per level

**Power Point Cost:** 1 per level each combat round to activate, 1 per combat round to keep active

Energy Control allows manipulation of a single type of energy, generating it if it is not already present (see **Energy Types**). Each type is a separate superpower, chosen when the power is purchased, and specified as ‘Energy Control (Cold)’, ‘Energy Control (Darkness)’, etc. Multiple types of Energy Control must be purchased separately. An obvious concept is to purchase multiple powers relating to a single energy type, such as Absorption, Armor, Energy Projection, Resistance, and Snare Projection, all based on the same type.

Each level of Energy Control is equivalent to 1 point in a resistance roll.

**_For example,_** _if trying to affect an area, the level is equal to SIZ. If trying to overcome the STR of an opponent, the level is equal to STR._

When directed at a specific target (as opposed to an environment or area), a resistance roll using the power’s level as the active force may be required. Whenever possible, use the resistance table if the power significantly affects something (or someone).

An Agility or Grapple roll may be required to touch an unwilling target, or Projection to make a ranged attack. Generally, an unaware target is _Easy_ to hit, and a willing target requires no roll.

Once a superpower is active, it can be deactivated instantaneously, ending the major effects. Lingering effects may remain (frost, smoke, sparks, etc.), but without causing damage unless activating some aspect of the environment (sparks lighting a forest fire, etc.).

Following are specific guidelines for each energy type:

- **Cold Control:** Cover an item or section of floor with ice, freeze a liquid, make an item brittle and easier to shatter, or freeze an opponent’s limb (or entire body) as with Snare Projection. The power affects 1 SIZ point per level, where applicable. Defeat the target’s CON vs. the superpower’s levels in a resistance roll. Failure means that the target takes 1D6 damage per 10 levels of Cold Control (round up) from the intense cold. Any appropriate environmental effects may also be applied (see **Cold**). Protection such as winterized clothing may serve as Protection 1 or more, at your gamemaster’s discretion. Each level of Cold Control cancels the effects of one level of Heat Control.
- **Darkness Control:** Each level creates a volume of darkness two meters in radius, centered around the character or at a point within range of their choosing. Within this volume, all creatures without some form of infrared vision suffer all penalties of fighting in darkness (see **Darkness**). Any normal benefits from intense darkness also apply, such as to the Hide skill. Darkness Control does not cause any damage. There is no resistance to Darkness Control, as it is not directly cast on a target. The only counter to it is a light-based power, a non-visual sense, a super sense, or some other means of detection such as sonar. Each additional level adds another meter to the volume of darkness. Darkness Control cancels Light Control on a level-for-level basis.
- **Electric Control:** Manipulating ambient electric current or generating fresh current. Each level provides enough electricity to affect 1 SIZ point of an electrical appliance or vehicle. Additionally, the power can cause 1D6 electrical damage per 10 levels (round up), if a resistance roll is made with the superpower’s levels vs. the target’s CON. Other uses may include shorting out any non-insulated equipment that has metallic parts and runs on a power current (use the object’s SIZ in a resistance roll), or to transfer ambient electricity into a storage battery at the rate of 1 power point per point of stored electricity.
- **Gravity Control:** Increase or decrease a target’s SIZ by 1 point per level (similar to Density Control). The target can be a living being or an inanimate object. This may adjust hit points and the damage modifier. If used against an object, use the superpower’s levels vs. the object’s hit points for the resistance roll. Against another character, it is an opposed power points resistance roll. A character whose SIZ has doubled or been reduced by half (round up) involuntarily has all their combat and physical actions made **Difficult**, due to their unfamiliarity with the current weight. If the target is accustomed to this power’s effects, or is voluntarily under its influence, there is no modifier. Gravity Control can be used offensively causing physical damage from intense gravity. Once a target is under its effects, on the powers phase of the next round, the gravity can be increased to do damage at the rate of 1D6 points per 10 levels (round up). When the power is deactivated, the target instantly regains its original weight.
- **Heat Control:** Each level fills 1 SIZ of an area with flame or snuffs out that much existing flame. It can be shaped and otherwise manipulated, used to ignite an object, provide light, or warm an area. If directed against a living being, the target must be overcome by the superpower’s levels vs. their power points in a resistance roll. Heat Control causes 1D6 damage per 10 levels (round up) to the target it is directed against. Heat Control can also be used to melt items, using the power’s level vs. the object’s SIZ or hit points in a resistance roll, adjusting the object’s SIZ based on how meltable it is. Each successful resistance roll melting an object does the power’s level in damage to the object and lowers its SIZ by the same amount. When the hit points or SIZ reach 0, the object is melted completely. Heat Control cancels the effects of Cold Control on a level-for-level basis.
- **Kinetic Control:** Exert crushing force on an item or targeted opponent, affecting an area equal to 1 SIZ per level. If a target’s CON is overcome with the superpower’s levels on a resistance roll, they suffer 1D6 damage per 10 levels (round up) from pure kinetic force. If directed against a nonliving target, the object’s current hit points are used for the resistance roll. It can also inhibit kinetic force in an area, creating a form of armor against physical attacks or action. This can lessen damage from a fall or duplicate the effects of Armor (Kinetic), though it must be targeted specifically and only lasts one combat round. If uncertain about what Kinetic Control can do, assume it is the equivalent of a rapid or forceful movement, not subtle or dexterous.
- **Light Control:** Each level fills 1 SIZ point of an area or illuminates 1 SIZ point of an object with the brightness of a light bulb. The light can be of any color desired, and can strobe, pulse, or radiate from any source within range. Light Control can potentially blind a target if it strikes them in the eyes with a successful strike and they are overcome in a resistance roll of the superpower’s levels vs. their power points. All sight-based actions for a blinded character become **Difficult** for one combat round, after which the blindness wears off. Light Control does not cause damage. Additional forms of light (infrared, ultraviolet, etc.) may also be created and used by this power, with effects to be determined by you and your gamemaster, using the superpower’s levels as a guideline. Light Control cancels the effects of Darkness Control on a level-for-level basis. For laser intensity, see Energy Projection (Light).
- **Magnetic Control:** Affect, magnetize, and manipulate 1 SIZ per level of metal or metallic substances, move them using magnetism, or affix one metallic object to another magnetically. Magnetic Control does not cause damage to most living beings, though it can be used to damage any mechanical item with metallic parts (use the object’s SIZ in a resistance roll) and disrupt electronic equipment or erase magnetically stored electronic media (memory cards, hard drives, disks, etc.). If using Magnetic Control against a countering force, use the object’s SIZ for a resistance roll.
- **Radiation Control:** Flood an area 1 SIZ per level with radiation equaling 1 potency (POT) per level or eliminate it in the same area. When used against a living being, defeat the target’s CON in the resistance roll vs. the superpower’s level. Radiation Control inflicts 1D6 damage per 10 levels (round up) to the target. To cause radiation poisoning, overcome the target’s CON+POW vs. the power’s level in a resistance roll. The nature of this radiation must be approved by your gamemaster (see **Radiation**).
- **Sound Control:** Affect 1 SIZ per level of an object or the sound in an area, silencing it, increasing its volume, etc. This power can also duplicate sonic or ultrasonic forms of sound. In combat, create a cacophony or loud blast of painful sound, using the superpower’s level vs. the target’s CON in a resistance roll. Success means that the target is stunned for 1D3 rounds (see **Stunning or Subduing**). Additionally, for the duration of the stunned state, the target’s Listen skill rolls are Impossible and mental skill rolls are _Difficult_. For less offensive uses, create phantom noises, mimic sounds, transfer sound from one place to another (within range), and even duplicate any sound previously heard (use an Idea roll to determine how correctly the sound is remembered). Sound Control can also destroy inanimate objects, doing 1D6 points of damage per 10 levels (round up) to an object whose hit points or CON is overcome in a resistance roll. Sound Control can oppose itself as well as other sound-based attacks such as Sound Projection.
- **Wind Control:** Control the wind, stirring air currents to incredible force, whether in a straight line or whirlwind. Though Wind Control does not cause direct damage, it can oppose foes’ movement, hold a target in place in a vortex of wind, blow something onto a target, hinder missile weapons used in range, create a tornado, fill a sail with wind, fan a fire into an inferno, or blow a fire out. Use the rules for knockback, using the power’s level, where applicable. Wind Control is not subtle, and its effects are often difficult to control. When appropriate, use the power’s levels vs. the target’s SIZ or STR in a resistance roll. **Weather Conditions** includes other effects that might be simulated using Wind Control.
- **Other Energy Control:** This category covers any undefined or new sort of Energy Control you and your gamemaster may devise. The guidelines for the other types of Energy Control can be used to determine the parameters for new types of energy, with the following guidelines: 1 level equals 1 SIZ point of energy to be manipulated or generated; if appropriate, the power will do 1D6 points of damage per 10 levels of the power (round up); base range is 15 meters. When in doubt, determine a means by which the superpower can be used in a resistance roll.
- **Combined Energy Control:** Your character can combine these superpowers if they pay the full amount for each Energy Control type. Each aspect of the power will have full effectiveness, though damage is rolled separately for each type, as the target may have different types of Absorption, Armor, Protection, or Resistance. Levels of combined Energy Control types do not have to be equivalent. All special effects for each Energy Control type are added onto this attack. For combined attacks, each use costs the full amount of power points required for the power.

You and your gamemaster should discuss further potential uses for each energy type, though whenever the use of the superpower seems to duplicate another power, that superpower should be purchased instead. This superpower does not grant immunity to the energy type being used—instead, the character is immune to the initial release of the energy but is susceptible to it later. Purchase levels in Absorption, Armor, Protection, or Resistance, if desired.

Many of these energy types can be used to duplicate or mimic environmental effects described in _Chapter 7: Spot Rules_.

### Energy Projection

**Base Range:** 15 meters

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Character Point Cost:** 10 per level

**Power Point Cost:** 1 per level

Energy Projection allows the projection of a beam of concentrated energy of some type (see **Energy Types**) at a target. Each type is a separate power and must be purchased separately: choose when the superpower is purchased and note it as Cold Projection, Darkness Projection, etc. Multiple types of Energy Projection must be purchased separately. Each cause 1D6 damage per level with a 15-meter range, and each additional level increases damage by +1D6 and range by +15 meters. To strike a target in combat, use the Projection skill, though Projection is not defined separately for each energy type.

Following are commonly used types of energy projection, and some potential side effects. Work with your gamemaster to develop additional appropriate side effects for these or any new types of Energy Projection.

- **Cold Projection:** Generates a ray of intense cold or ice, doing 1D6 damage per level. When used against a physical object, a POW×level chance causes the object to become brittle, halving its armor value and hit points for one combat round.
- **Darkness Projection:** Fires a harmful bolt of intense darkness, doing 1D6 damage per level. If targeted against a foe’s eyes, it can blind them for 1D3 combat rounds (see **Darkness**).
- **Electric Projection:** A lightning bolt (or ball of lightning) that does 1D6 damage per level. When used on a metallic object, it has a POW×level chance of traveling (and jumping) along any connected or nearby metallic surface to strike any other target touching the metal surface. Successive targets take ½ of the original damage (round up). Additionally, it can scramble any electric or electronic equipment it hits, using its power level against the item’s hit points in a resistance roll.
- **Gravity Projection:** A pure wave of gravitic energy, causing everything it hits to either become incredibly heavy or light, as desired, doing 1D6 damage per level. In addition to damage, it can sweep items aside or cause them to plummet to the ground, taking damage as appropriate (see **Knockback**, or **Falling**).
- **Heat Projection:** A line of flame or intense heat, doing 1D6 damage per level, with a POW×level chance of setting a flammable object on fire in addition to any damage it causes.
- **Kinetic Projection:** A beam of concussive force doing 1D6 damage per level, that on a special success also inflicts the effects of a crushing special success or knockback (player choice).
- **Light Projection:** A laser-like ray of light, doing 1D6 damage per level. It can temporarily blind an opponent for 1D3 combat rounds if it strikes them in the eyes (see **Aimed Attacks**) and the power brightly illuminates the area when it is used. If directed against an inanimate object (such as a wall or safe) for multiple rounds, it can cut through them, doing its normal damage.
- **Magnetic Projection:** This wave of magnetic force does 1D6 damage per level to electronic circuitry or machinery made of ferrous materials. Use the power’s level as the active force against the object’s hit point total in a resistance roll. If used against metallic objects, it can knock them back into other targets, doing damage as appropriate to SIZ.
- **Radiation Projection:** This beam of radioactive energy does 1D6 damage per level and can irradiate anything it hits, causing potential radiological reactions (exposing film, etc.) or even radiation sickness, using the damage dealt as its potency (POT) (see **Radiation**).
- **Sound Projection:** A shock wave radiating along a path towards the target, doing 1D6 damage per level. If targeted against the head or ears of a target, it can temporarily deafen them for 1D3 combat rounds if the power level overcomes their CON in a resistance roll. All hearing-based actions for a deafened character become _Difficult_ until the deafness wears off.
- **Wind Projection:** An intense blast of wind doing 1D6 damage per level and a knockback special success if the dice roll indicates so. It can also be used to knock items into other targets, doing damage as appropriate to SIZ, and on a _Difficult_ Projection roll, can parry low-velocity missile weapons (thrown, arrows, etc.).
- **Other Energy Projection:** See **Other Energy Control** for suggestions on creating new energy types.
- **Combined Energy Projection:** These attacks can be combined if each Energy Projection type is purchased separately. Levels do not have to be equivalent. A single successful Projection roll means that all Energy Projection types hit the target. Each Energy Projection type has its normal effectiveness, though resistance rolls and side effects must be determined separately. Damage is rolled separately for each type, as the target may have different types of Absorption, Armor, Protection, or Resistance. For combined Energy Projection attacks, each attack costs the full amount of power points for all levels and all types of energy used.

Many of these have variable effectiveness against certain types of defenses, such as a Fire Projection being weak against cold-based defenses, or a Magnetic Projection being especially powerful against metallic defenses. At your gamemaster’s option, the power level of the Energy Projection may be checked in a resistance roll against the resisting force to see if it has any effect: superpowers that would be weak against a particular defense are at –5 to their level for the purpose of the resistance roll, while powers especially potent against a defense are at +5 their power level for the resistance roll (as if a special success—if a special or critical success is rolled, these bonuses stack).

### Extra Energy

**Base Range:** Self

**Duration:** Always on

**Character Point Cost:** 1 per 10 points of additional power points

**Power Point Cost:** None

_This should be taken by every character wishing to use superpowers._ This is an additional energy reserve above and beyond the power points granted by POW. Each level is +10 additional power points (there is no effect on POW). The energy source may be from the character’s own body or an external item like a battery. Internal energy supplies can fuel personal powers, and external batteries can fuel external items. The gamemaster may allow your character to draw from either. The source is relevant as an external battery may be targeted. Multiple energy supplies may also be used, each fueling different powers or being used by the same powers.

Some superpowers do not need power points to activate, though many others do, in one of the following ways:

- The power points activate the superpower, with no further power point cost until the superpower is activated again. This includes most instantaneous powers.
- The power point cost must be paid each round the superpower is in use.
- Expended energy (power points) returns to your character as described in **Power Points**. Batteries must be replenished by recharging. One common method is a wall socket, though others such as batteries, solar panels, and generators can be used. Absorption can be used to recharge personal or external energy supplies if the energy type matches.

### Extra Hit Points

**Base Range:** Self

**Duration:** Always on

**Character Point Cost:** 1 per level

**Power Point Cost:** None

Additional hit points beyond what CON and SIZ provide. Your character cannot purchase more levels in Extra Hit Points than their initial CON, unless your gamemaster allows it. These hit points are added to normal hit points, and the major wound threshold is adjusted to the new total. Healing is as normal. If hit locations are used, the combined hit point total is used to determine hit points per location.

### Flight

**Base Range:** Self

**Duration:** Varies

**Character Point Cost:** 1 per level

**Power Point Cost:** 1 power point per 3 SIZ points to activate, then 1 power point per turn to maintain

Once this power is activated, use the Fly skill to fly 3 SIZ per level at a rate of 500 meters per combat round or any speed lower than this, including a hover. Your character must purchase enough levels of Flight to accommodate their SIZ. The ability to carry anything else while flying depends on STR and any additional levels of Flight above those needed to remain airborne. In non-combat situations, your gamemaster may allow each power point spent to maintain flight last for 1 hour rather than one turn. Once the initial power points are spent, your character can land and fly at will for the duration of the power without needing to spend the initial power point cost again.

This flight is not automatically maneuverable or graceful. Flight requires some finesse to properly use, handled with the Fly skill. This superpower is a prerequisite for the Fly skill: if the power is innate, it begins at the starting skill rating, and ½ of DEX (round up) as a skill rating if granted by equipment.

If used in conjunction with Super Speed, the number of additional meters provided by the Super Speed is added to the meters per combat round. For reference, 500 meters per combat round is a speed of roughly 85 miles per hour.

### Force Field

**Base Range:** Self to 15 meters

**Duration:** Varies

**Character Point Cost:** 1 per level per energy type per point of SIZ

**Power Point Cost:** 1 per combat round, plus 1 per point of damage absorbed

The ability to project a defensive field that provides 10 points of armor per level to 1 SIZ from incoming injury based on a specific energy or attack type.

**_For example,_** _a character of SIZ 14 must pay 14 points for Force Field 1, 28 points for Force Field 2, etc._

The energy type the Force Field protects against must be specified when the superpower is purchased, selected from the **Energy Types** list. A Force Field can protect against multiple types of energy, though each type must be purchased separately.

Damage is rolled for any attacks against anything protected by the Force Field, and the Force Field’s armor value (10×level) is then subtracted from that damage. Any damage beyond that is subtracted from your character’s power points, if desired. If the Force Field is dealt more damage in a single blow than the amount you have specified protection for, or exceeds your character’s available power points, the Force Field is dissipated.

Typically, the Force Field is centered on the character, though they can project it to cover other objects or beings adjacent to them, or anywhere within range.

### Intangibility

**Base Range:** Self

**Duration:** Varies

**Character Point Cost:** 2 per level

**Power Point Cost:** 1 per point of SIZ per level, then 1 power point per combat round

Each level allows movement of 1 SIZ through 10 centimeters of wall or other materials per combat round and allows the character to ‘fly’ by walking on air at a normal walking speed. While intangible, your character cannot be affected by kinetic or thermal (cold and heat) forces of any sort and cannot use any attacks resulting in the same forces. Your character can still be affected by radiation or other non-kinetic forces and can use them as well. Each extra level adds another 10 centimeters to the distance that can be passed through in a combat round (up to normal movement rate) or can be used to affect another SIZ point outside of their own SIZ. Once active, intangibility can be maintained at a cost of 1 power point per combat round, though it ends if your character is knocked unconscious or runs out of power points. If your character takes damage in a combat round, your gamemaster may require a successful Idea roll to maintain the intangibility. If desired, your gamemaster may determine that certain materials are easier to pass through than others, based on the guidelines presented in _Chapter 8: Equipment_. Denser materials may slow or even stop an intangible character from passing through.

### Invisibility

**Base Range:** 15 meters

**Duration:** 1 combat round

**Character Point Cost:** 1 per level per point of SIZ

**Power Point Cost:** 1 per point of SIZ to activate, then 1 power point per combat round

Each level allows your character to turn invisible 1 SIZ of themselves, another character, or an object or portion of an object. Your character must concentrate on the superpower and do no more than walk or speak. Fighting, using other superpowers, or suffering similar distractions (injury, intense physical activity) breaks the effects and causes the invisible subject to become visible. Any attacks against an invisible character or object are at 1/5 the normal skill rating. Any parries are equally difficult, requiring a successful Listen, Sense, or Spot roll to even attempt parrying. A successful roll for one of these skills to overcome the Invisibility reduces the penalty of attacks to _Difficult_ instead of 1/5.

There are few limitations to what actions can be performed while invisible. One can move, attack, flee, or stand still as long as the superpower is active. Invisibility can be deactivated at any time, though starting it again requires activating the superpower again. In combat, the rules for **Ambushes** and **Backstabs and Helpless Opponents** may be relevant.

### Leap

**Base Range:** 2 meters per level

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Character Point Cost:** 1 per level

**Power Point Cost:** None

Each level adds an additional 2 horizontal meters or 1 vertical meter to normal jumping range. Leap only adds to the range of the Jump skill and does not require a roll or power points to use. The Jump skill must still be used successfully when appropriate (in combat, not during normal movement). A Leap counts as a normal movement action during a combat round. As with Jump, landing successfully is automatic, no matter how great the controlled leap. However, a successful Agility roll may be required if trying to catch a building ledge or land somewhere small or requiring balance. This roll may be _Difficult_ for especially small or narrow perches (a windowsill, power line, or atop a streetlight).

If falling, the Jump skill may be used to reduce damage. If the Jump skill roll is successful, reduce the distance fallen by 3 meters for every level of Leap.

In combat, your character can leap at an opponent to gain extra damage. Each level of Leap used (up to the character’s SIZ) can be added to the character’s total of STR and SIZ to determine a new damage modifier (if any) on a physical attack. The levels of Leap you can use for this increase to damage modifier are those of the actual distance leaped, not the overall levels, and the damage modifier only applies for the first attack made during the attack. A successful Jump roll must be made in addition to the normal attack roll.

Consult the damage modifier table and the Jump skill for more information. Depending on how high and far a character jumps, **Aerial Combat** in _Chapter 7: Spot Rules_ may be useful.

### Protection

**Base Range:** Self or touch

**Duration:** 1 combat round

**Character Point Cost:** 1 per level per energy type

**Power Point Cost:** 1 point per level per combat round

When purchased, Protection must be specified for a particular type of energy, such as Protection (Kinetic). Each level of Protection reduces the level of the appropriate superpower directed at your character. This may reduce the attacking superpower’s level to 0, meaning that it has no effect. Multiple types of Protection can be purchased. There is no requirement for all types of Protection to be at the same level, so your character could have Protection (Kinetic) 2 and Protection (Heat) 5. If an attack uses multiple types of energy, only the applicable types of the superpower are reduced through the Protection power.

Many types of armor and equipment incorporate the Protection power (see _Chapter 8: Equipment_ for more information).

### Regeneration

**Base Range:** Self

**Duration:** Always on

**Character Point Cost:** 3 per level

**Power Point Cost:** 1 per hit point healed per combat round

This superpower gives the ability to heal extremely fast, drawing on the body’s natural energies to accelerate the natural healing process. Each level of Regeneration heals 1 hit point of damage every combat round at the end of the combat round (DEX rank 0), if there are power points remaining. Regeneration does not have to be activated to work, though it may be deactivated at will. This superpower will not bring your character back from the dead but will heal damage that would normally require hospitalization. Regeneration will also heal the effects of any major wound, though the effects of this healing will take place once all hit points from the injury have been completely restored. Your gamemaster will determine if severed body parts can be restored. Your character cannot purchase more levels of Regeneration than ½ their CON (round up). Various equipment may confer this power, as described in _Chapter 8: Equipment_.

### Resistance

**Base Range:** Self or touch

**Duration:** Always on, or 1 full turn (5 minutes)

**Character Point Cost:** 1 per level for turn-based, 3 per level if permanent

**Power Point Cost:** 1 per level used if turn-based, none if permanent

Resistance serves as an artificial shield allowing a greater chance of resisting attacks of a particular energy type. Each level of Resistance must be specified towards an energy type (see **Energy Types**) and either adds to a passive characteristic in a resistance roll, or provides a resistance value if there is no applicable characteristic.

Resistance is an all-or-nothing power. If Resistance overcomes the attacking energy type, that energy type has no further effect. If Resistance fails to resist the active energy type, Resistance has no effect.

Additional types of Resistance can be introduced, other than energy types, such as:

- **Disease:** This increases resistance to disease, adding to CON in resistance rolls against illness, infection, or other sickness. Resistance (Disease) also applies to any other characteristic (such as STR) the disease acts against in a resistance roll.
- **Poison:** This increases resistance to poison, whether natural toxins or some manufactured chemical compounds. It also provides resistance to non-poisonous chemical influences, such as drugs, alcohol, or other non-lethal substances. In all cases, levels in Resistance (Poison) are added to CON or the applicable characteristic.

This power works well in tandem with Armor and/or Protection. At your gamemaster’s discretion, Resistance can be expanded to encompass entire power sets, such as Resistance (Magic) or Resistance (Psychic), but it is suggested that this widespread Resistance be significantly more expensive, such as 10 points per level.

### Sidekick

**Base Range:** Not applicable

**Duration:** Always on

**Character Point Cost:** Variable

**Power Point Cost:** None

A Sidekick is a secondary character controlled alongside your own character. The Sidekick is loyal and potentially possesses similar skills and powers. You and your gamemaster should create the Sidekick as if it is a new character, though the Sidekick does not have to be human. The Sidekick’s characteristics and skills must be purchased as if they were Super Characteristics and Super Skills, out of your character’s point budget. If the Sidekick is a natural animal, determine its characteristics and skills normally, adjusting as desired, and then pay for them, using the above powers. The Sidekick can have powers and equipment, but these must also be paid for out of your character’s point budget.

Generally, a Sidekick has powers and skills like its ‘owner’, though this is not necessary. A Sidekick usually has the following attributes:

- It is loyal to the owner, though it may disagree and occasionally rebel.
- It often idolizes its owner and fashions its appearance after them.
- It depends on its owner for living arrangements and necessities.
- It often gets into trouble, and sometimes must be rescued. This should happen at least twice as often as a Sidekick is able to rescue its owner.
- It is often younger and less experienced than its owner, though it can increase in experience as a normal character would. The Sidekick’s owner can determine how the Sidekick will improve powers through their earned character point budget.

When the Sidekick is finished, you run the Sidekick as a secondary character, rolling for it and guiding its actions. Occasionally, your gamemaster may choose to roleplay the Sidekick and make rolls for them, though this should be rare. The Sidekick is in most cases an extension of your character’s identity, and you should have control over the Sidekick’s behavior. Sidekicks can improve characteristics and skills, just like a character.

Normally, your character can only have one Sidekick at a time, though your gamemaster may allow you to purchase an additional Sidekick or more. Your character cannot have a Sidekick with a higher POW than your character. If this happens due to POW increases, the Sidekick leaves your character’s service (becoming a character controlled by your gamemaster, or even by another player) and your character gets ½ of the original character point budget back. If a Sidekick is killed, your character gets ½ of the original character point budget back. Similarly, if you want your character to release the Sidekick, they get ½ of the Sidekick’s current character point budget back (this should be calculated from current characteristics, skills, and powers). This way, it is more profitable in the long run to nurture and train a Sidekick before parting ways, rather than to let them outstrip your character or get killed in the line of duty.

### Size Change

**Base Range:** Self

**Duration:** Varies

**Character Point Cost:** 1 per level

**Power Point Cost:** 1 per level to activate, no cost to keep active

Size Change allows an increase or reduction of SIZ by ±1 point per level (no maximum, minimum 0). When this power is purchased, you must specify whether it is to grow or to shrink. To do both, buy the superpower twice.

Growing to giant size has the following effects:

- Hit points are likely increased, so recalculate your character’s hit point total based on the average of CON and SIZ. This also affects the major wound threshold and hit points per location.
- Damage modifier may increase, as it is the total of STR+SIZ.
- Increasing SIZ by 20 or more points makes your character twice as easy to hit in combat. Any attacks against them are considered _Easy_.
- If fatigue points are used, they are not affected by being giant-sized.

Shrinking has the following effects:

- Hit points may be decreased, so recalculate based on the average of CON and SIZ. This also affects the major wound threshold and hit points per location.
- Damage modifier may decrease, as it is the total of STR+SIZ.
- Shrinking to SIZ 1 or 0 makes your character much harder to hit: all attacks against them become _Difficult_. For a SIZ below 0 (see below), it may be _Impossible_ to be hit with normal weaponry, though attacks with an area of effect (like a flamethrower) still work if your character can be spotted, at your gamemaster’s discretion.
- Hiding becomes _Easy_ when your character is SIZ 3 or below. At SIZ 1 or 0, only a critical result for a Spot roll finds your character.
- Your character’s physical attributes are also affected in several unquantifiable ways (volume, etc.).
- If fatigue points are used, they are not affected by being tiny.
- Your gamemaster may allow your character to shrink beyond SIZ 0, though this is outside the scope of these rules.

Once activated, this superpower does not cost any further power points to maintain. If your character is knocked unconscious, goes to sleep, runs out of power points, or is hit with something that cancels any active superpowers, Size Change deactivates and your character returns to their normal SIZ.

If your character takes a major wound while using Size Change, they must make a successful Stamina roll to maintain the current SIZ. If the roll fails, your character reverts to their original SIZ. If your character has taken damage while in giant or tiny form, the switch back to normal size gives your character’s normal hit points or those from the alternate-sized body, whichever is currently lower. If your character has already taken damage before using the Size Change power, your gamemaster should take note of the damage your character has already taken before figuring the new hit point total. Once these have been determined, your gamemaster should apply this damage to your character’s new hit point total. This may incapacitate your character if they are shrinking.

The spot rules for **Big and Little Targets** may be of use. Consult the **Object SIZ Examples** table for guidance on larger SIZ ratings.

### Snare Projection

**Base Range:** 15 meters

**Duration:** Until destroyed or 10 combat rounds

**Character Point Cost:** 1 per level

**Power Point Cost:** 1 point per use

Snare Projection creates an entrapping force (webbing, lasso, energy cage, blob of adhesive, extensible limb, etc.) that can be used against a target within range. The snare has STR equal to the superpower’s level. Use of the power is automatic, though directing it may involve a skill check (see below). Being entrapped by Snare Projection forces the target to make a STR vs. STR resistance roll or be held as if entangled (see the entangle special success). If the resistance roll overcomes the snare’s STR, the snare dissipates (if appropriate) or is otherwise shrugged aside. If used against multiple opponents, the levels of Snare Projection are distributed evenly among the targets, with you choosing which foe gets any leftover levels. Each target is required to make a STR vs. STR resistance roll to break free of the snare.

The range of the snare can be increased by allocating levels to it instead of to its STR, on a per-use basis. Each level adds another 15 meters to the range.

Snare Projection may require the Throw or Projection skills. Ask your gamemaster which applies. If it is a piece of equipment, the relevant weapon or gear use skill should be used to determine if Snare Projection hits the target. If the power is not intrinsic and is a piece of gear, the rules on powered equipment from _Chapter 8: Equipment_ may be of relevance. Consult the rules for entangling for additional detail.

### Stretching

**Base Range:** Self

**Duration:** Varies

**Character Point Cost:** 3 per level

**Power Point Cost:** None

Each level allows your character to stretch their entire body (or some portion) for 1 meter in any direction. Additionally, if the total levels of Stretching are equal to twice your character’s CON, they are capable of stretching in even more remarkable ways, through keyholes, under doors, gliding like a kite on the wind, mimicking items of furniture or other objects, or other examples of extraordinary plasticity. Expanding in SIZ will always be limited to your character’s normal SIZ plus the levels of Stretching, and your character can contract their body to a SIZ equal to their SIZ characteristic minus the superpower’s levels (minimum SIZ 1). Every meter stretched lowers current STR by 1, which may lower the damage modifier.

If knocked unconscious, goes to sleep, runs out of power points, or is attacked with a force that cancels any existing superpowers, Stretching deactivates and your character returns to their normal shape. If your character takes a major wound while stretching, they must make a successful Endurance roll to maintain the current shape. If that roll fails, your character reverts to their original form.

Your character can use Stretching to improvise the effects of another superpower such as Absorption, Barrier, Defense, Flight, Super Sense, Leap, Resistance, Shape Change, Size Change, Snare Projection, or others. In these cases, your gamemaster should require you to describe exactly what your character is doing, and your character must succeed in an Idea roll. If successful, your character can spend double the relevant power points and temporarily have ½ their Stretching levels in the superpower being imitated. Repeatedly mimicking a superpower your character does not have may require you to purchase levels in that mimicked superpower, at your gamemaster’s discretion.

### Super Characteristic

**Base Range:** Self

**Duration:** Always on

**Character Point Cost:** 1 per point of STR, CON, SIZ, or CHA; 3 points for each point of DEX, INT, POW, and EDU

**Power Point Cost:** None

Each level adds +1 of STR, CON, SIZ, INT, POW, DEX, CHA, or EDU to your character’s original characteristics. All characteristic rolls and figured abilities (hit points, fatigue points, power points, and sanity points) may increase. If STR and/or SIZ are increased, damage modifier may also increase. Increases to INT and EDU grant higher initial skill points, as described in **Step Seven** of character creation.

### Super Movement

**Base Range:** Self

**Duration:** Varies

**Character Point Cost:** 10 per type

**Power Point Cost:** 1 per combat round

Each type allows your character to move their normal MOV rate in an unconventional manner or one that defies physics. Each type must be purchased separately, but there are no levels—the movement simply works if the power points are spent. Carrying capacity is based on normal STR, and heavy weights are handled with a resistance roll. Following are some common Super Movement types. You and your gamemaster may devise others using these as examples.

- **Air Walking:** Walking upon the air itself, as on invisible walkways and staircases, immaterial to anyone else. Your character can carry others, as if on normal ground.
- **Irresistible:** Moving through water or any environmental condition as if without resistance. Hazards that would normally slow movement (water, mud, etc.) are no hindrance, allowing the full movement rate. This also applies to movement speed outside of combat, ignoring weather or terrain effects, but it does not apply to resistance from unnatural conditions, such as Snare Projection or a physical barrier.
- **Lightfoot:** Lightfoot allows a normal movement rate while in the air, leaping from surface to surface, gliding, skipping, or making slight motions upon solid surfaces to maintain movement. Lightfoot lets your character stand on surfaces that would not normally support their weight, such as a bamboo reed, a slender tree branch, a sword point, or even a house of cards. moving as if gravity has no effect. Your character can run lightly up rough walls or trees, or even skip across water or the surface of snow. They cannot remain in the air indefinitely, and to change direction (right, left, or even up or down) requires a successful Agility roll as well as additional power points spent.
- **Trackless**: Moving across the ground or the surface of snow and leaving absolutely no track unless desired. Only special successes on Track rolls can find a Trackless trail, and the result will only be a standard success. Your character can stand still or even cartwheel across a surface and will not leave tracks. This power is intrinsic and cannot be shared. Carrying any more than a normal burden negates it entirely.
- **Wall Walking:**W alking on walls and ceilings, whether on all fours or standing upright. Your character can stand still on vertical or upside-down surfaces as if on the ground, and jumping keeps them on the same plane. Carrying additional weight must be handled through a normal STR resistance roll.
- **Water Walking:** Walking or running across water as if it were solid ground, meeting no resistance from waves and not sinking. Unlike Lightfoot, your character can stand still on the water’s surface, though turbulent water will cause them to sway with the motions of the waves. Your character can also surf along rapid-moving water, riding the current and being swept along as if on a surfboard or conveyor belt. Your gamemaster should determine how rapid the water is and may require Agility or Jump rolls to overcome obstacles such as outcropping stones in river rapids.
- **Zero-gravity:** Your character can ignore the effects of zero gravity, orienting their body in relation to whatever object or plane in three-dimensional space they inhabit. Your character can move easily through zero-g environments, incurring no penalties to actions, and even when in deep space will always be able to find a comfortable orientation. They can use Super Movement (Zero-gravity) to orient other characters in zero-g through touch.

When using Super Movement, if a conscious character falls, they can attempt an Idea roll to remain on the surface they are on (air, water, ceiling, wall, etc.) rather than sink or fall to earth. If your character is knocked unconscious or runs out of power points while using Super Movement, they fall to the ground, sink beneath the water, etc. as appropriate. If your character is using normal movement and is presented with an opportunity, they can make a _Difficult_ Agility roll to switch to Super Movement, such as being hurled through the air towards a wall and using Lightfoot or Wall Walking to land on the wall, in control and unharmed.

### Super Sense

**Base Range:** Varies

**Duration:** Always on

**Character Point Cost:** 3 per level

**Power Point Cost:** None

Super Sense represents a variety of superpowers, each keyed to a principal sense. Each must be bought separately and should be noted like ‘Super Sense (Dark Vision)’. Different Super Senses can be combined, using the same skill roll, or they can be used separately. Following are common Super Senses, though you and your gamemaster may introduce others:

- **Dark Vision:** See 15 meters in absolute darkness, canceling any negative modifiers to the Spot or combat skills due to darkness. Detection of color is almost nonexistent, and long-range sight is extremely limited. Each extra level increases the range by 15 meters.
- **Microscopic Vision:** See microscopic objects in considerable detail. At level 1, the rate of magnification is 25× (25 times normal size). For each additional level, double the existing magnification (25× becomes 50×, then 100×, then 200×, etc.), or add an additional 15 meters range. Use of Microscopic Vision is incompatible with normal sight—it must be deactivated to perceive the world normally. This can be done instantly, but it must be reactivated to use again.
- **Night Vision:** If there is a source of light (however faint), your character can see with perfect clarity for 15 meters. This cancels any negative modifiers to Spot or combat due to partial darkness. Night Vision allows for some differentiation between colors and provides the sharpest form of vision in near-dark conditions. Each additional level increases the range by another 15 meters.
- **Sonar Detection:** Hear ambient sounds (or creates them) and use them for echolocation, determining the presence of other beings, obstacles, and the terrain in range. Each level provides a 15-meter, 360-degree field of sonar detection, projected from the head. Use the Listen skill to notice a particular feature, and an Idea roll to identify it. Each additional level of this power adds 15 meters to the range.
- **Super Hearing:** Each level doubles the effective range of the Listen skill. Normal hearing range is 15 meters, assuming there is no intervening obstacle (such as a wall) or noise-making interference. This can also be used to hear things outside human range of perception, such as an opponent’s heartbeat. This superpower also allows your character to hear opponents even if they have successfully used the Stealth skill. If an opponent has an average success on a Stealth roll, an **Easy** Listen roll detects them. If the opponent has a special success, an unmodified Listen success hears them. Even a critical success with Stealth is heard with a special success.
- **Super Smell/Taste:** Use their Sense skill to detect the taste of something a normal human would be unable to discern, such as a tasteless poison. Each level increases the range of the sense of smell by another 15 meters, so your character can smell something faint at great range. Taste increases by 1 meter per level, so your character can even taste something within range without having to consume it.
- S**uper Touch:** Each level lets the Sense skill detect subtle changes in texture through fingertips or other body parts. It also gives the ability to ‘see’ with exposed skin, acting in darkness as if in normal daylight, ignoring any penalties from darkness (use the Listen skill). Finally, it provides a POW×level chance of detecting oncoming missile weapons or other hand-to-hand attacks that might not be detected otherwise (an ambush or backstab). The range is 15 meters. Each additional level extends the range by 15 meters.
- **Super Vision:** Each level doubles the distance your character can see detail in, doubling the range at which they can use skills such as Spot. It also increases the magnification that your character is capable of, allowing them to perform skills such as Appraise at long range.
- **Thermal Vision:** Detect heat patterns within range, allowing them to see living beings in the dark through bodily heat. Heat sources appear as red blurs in a bluish-black background. Everything outside the range of the power is an indistinct blur, and the superpower does not allow detection of objects that do not emit heat, such as furniture or walls, unless they are wired to do so. Each additional level increases the range by another 15 meters.
- **Ultrasonic Hearing:** Hear sounds that would be inaudible to a normal human, above or below audible frequencies. Use your character’s Listen skill to see if the sound is noticed. A wall or other barrier 10 centimeters thick will block most sounds from passing through, but this superpower negates that blockage. Each additional level increases range by 15 meters and increases the ability to hear through barriers that would normally block sounds (2 levels allows hearing through 20 centimeters of barrier, 3 levels through 30 centimeters of barrier, etc.). Ultrasonic Hearing does not give your character sonar detection (as described above).
- **X-Ray Vision:** See through 10 centimeters of any substance per level, blocked only by a single substance such as lead, gold, or some other higher-density substance (player choice). The range is 15 meters. Each additional level increases range by 15 meters and the penetrating value of the power by an additional 10 centimeters. With enough levels, make Spot or other visual perception skill rolls unimpaired, even when obstructed by a barrier.

### Super Skill

**Base Range:** Self

**Duration:** Always on

**Character Point Cost:** 2 per level

**Power Point Cost:** None

Each level of Super Skill adds +20% to a single skill rating, above and beyond skill points spent during character creation. Additional levels can be stacked for greater bonuses. The increased skill rating also improves the likelihood of special successes and critical results, The Super Skill can increase with experience as normal: the bonus is not figured into the experience roll.

Based on the game power level, your gamemaster may wish to limit the total levels of this power your character can purchase or prohibit certain skills from being used with this power. See **Skill Ratings Over 100%** and **Attacks and Parries Over 100%** for useful information.

### Super Speed

**Base Range:** Self

**Duration:** Varies

**Character Point Cost:** 20 per level

**Power Point Cost:** 1 per level used per combat round

Super Speed increases the movement rate to 10×MOV per level and allows both full movement in a combat round as well as performing a combat action. Normally, your character is restricted to only one of these actions. Each additional level allows another full round of movement or another non-combat action. The extra full movement can be taken before, after, or at your character’s normal DEX rank plus the levels of Super Speed. When performing a normal action using Super Speed, your character acts at the usual DEX rank plus levels in Super Speed. Alternatively, your character can run all-out, performing a full movement for each level of Super Speed, plus their normal full movement without performing an action other than movement during the combat round. If your character is running all-out, they cannot perform an action in the combat round.

It is not necessary to use all levels of Super Speed at once: your character can choose to use fewer levels of Super Speed than they possess, spending less power points each combat round.

Super Speed used in a combat round modifies attacks against the character by –10% per level, assuming they are within range. However, if the attacker is also using the Super Speed power, the reduction to attack chances is based on the difference between levels, if the defender is higher than the attacker. If both Super Speed powers are of equal level, there is no modification to any attack chances, and there is no modification to the attack chances if the attacker has a higher Super Speed than the defender.

The Super Speed defensive bonus is cumulative with modifiers such as cover, darkness, etc. Area attacks are not affected by Super Speed if your character is in the affected area.

If making a physical attack at the end of a Super Speed charge, every level of Super Speed used increases the damage modifier by one step and adds the knockback special success effects if a special success is rolled. Use of this specific aspect of the power costs 1 additional power point per level.

### Teleport

**Base Range:** 1,000 meters

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Character Point Cost:** 1 per level

**Power Point Cost:** 1 per level

Teleport allows instantaneous teleportation of 1 SIZ per level from one place to another within range. Teleport can be used on things other than your character, either along with your character or independently, assuming there are adequate levels. Teleport does not need a targeting roll and can be used on anything within range. If the target is affixed to something or does not wish to be transported, your character must also successfully overcome the item’s hit points (or armor value) vs. their power points in a resistance roll. Clothes and personal gear in close contact with the subject accompany them when teleported. For an unwilling subject, make a resistance roll matching the power’s level with the subject’s current power points. A willing subject does not require a resistance roll.

A fumbled roll when using this superpower sends the subject into a solid object, perhaps even underground. Make a Luck roll to avoid this mishap. If the roll is successful, no damage is taken, and the teleported subject narrowly escapes this fate. If the roll fails, the subject immediately takes 3D6 points of damage. For a living being, roll on the **Major Wound Table**, adapting the result as appropriate. If sanity is used, a sanity loss of 1D6/3D6 for the victim is suggested, and 1D3/1D10 for the teleporting character. An object teleported becomes fused with another object, a structure, or the ground.

Teleport can also be used offensively in the following ways:

- Deliberately teleporting a living target or an item into a solid structure costs the target’s SIZ in power points and lets them make a _Difficult_ Luck roll to avoid this fate. Use the guidelines for a fumble, above, including potential sanity loss.
- Teleporting an object into a living being costs 6 power points per SIZ of the object and causes 1D6 damage per SIZ, if successful, with a _Difficult_ Luck roll allowing them to dodge or resist, as appropriate. If sanity is used, use the above guidelines.
- Teleporting an inanimate object into another requires your gamemaster to determine the outcome.
- A subject can be teleported into the air and dropped, letting gravity take hold (see **Falling**). An unwilling target can avoid this with a successful _Difficult_ Dodge roll.

Whether inadvertent or intentional, becoming fused with a solid item is usually traumatic for a living being, and the target must find some means of extricating themself from the item or structure (perhaps being teleported free or pulled out via Intangibility). Failure to do so can cause any major wound to have permanent effect.

Consult the section on objects in _Chapter 8: Equipment_ for sample sizes and hit points of items.

### Transfer

**Base Range:** Touch

**Duration:** 1 combat round

**Character Point Cost:** 3 per level for hit points, 1 per level for other resources (fatigue points, power points, sanity points)

**Power Point Cost:** None

Transfer moves an internal resource (hit points, power points, fatigue points, sanity points) from your character to another. It works similarly to Drain, though in the opposite direction. The rate of this transfer is 1 point per level per combat round, with additional levels increasing the points transferrable (level 2 transfers 2 points, etc.). The means can be a grab, a bite, a handshake, etc., but must involve physical contact for at least one full combat round. This may require a successful Grapple attempt if in combat, or Agility roll if outside of combat. No roll is required for an immobile or willing target, and an attempt against an unwary target is _Easy_. To continue to transfer points to an unwilling target on successive rounds, the maneuver (Grapple, etc.) must be rolled successfully each combat round. Failure breaks the contact.

Once contact has been established, your character can begin to transfer points. If the target is willing or unconscious, no resistance roll is required. An unwilling target can resist using a particular characteristic roll, described below. If they succeed in resisting, the transfer has no effect, and the intended recipient can attempt to break free. If successful, the resource is transferred from your character to the recipient in the powers phase of the next round.

The power works the same for any resource:

- Your character can transfer 1 resource point per level per combat round.
- Your character cannot transfer more of the resource than they currently possess.
- The target cannot accept more of the resource than their normal maximum, other than power points (see **Power Points**). Any resource points beyond the maximum are lost.

These four resources can be transferred, with the following guidelines:

- **Hit Points:** If your character reduces their own current hit point total to 1 or 2 hit points, they will fall unconscious. It is possible to transfer all your character’s hit points to the recipient, but this requires a successful POW×1 roll to go below 1 hit point before falling unconscious. At 0 hit points, your character is unconscious and begins to die, as described in H**it Points**. Your character cannot transfer enough hit points to go into negative hit points. A recipient can resist with a Stamina roll.
- **Power Points:** If your character’s power point total reaches 0, they fall unconscious. A recipient can resist with a Luck roll.
- **Fatigue Points:** If your character’s fatigue points reach 0, see the rules for **Fatigue**. A recipient can resist with a Stamina roll.
- **Sanity Points:** Adding sanity points does not eliminate any temporary or indefinite insanity the target suffers—it merely increases the chance of success for future sanity rolls. Specific insanities must be dealt with through psychotherapy and treatment. A character whose sanity points reach 0 is hopelessly insane and outside player control. Consult the rules for sanity. Your character can transfer as many SAN as they desire up to the target’s maximum allowed SAN (see **Maximum Sanity**). If the target wishes to act against your character, they must make a successful Luck roll to do so.

This superpower works well with Drain, allowing one character to restore resource points they have transferred to others, or drain from one character and transfer to another, with them as the conduit.

### Unarmed Combat

**Base Range:** Self

**Duration:** Always on, or 5 combat rounds

Power Cost: 20 per level

**Power Point Cost:** None

This represents an exceptional level of hand-to-hand combat training, whether secret techniques, ninjutsu, mystic fighting styles, or hyper-advanced fisticuffs. No roll or power points are required—your character must announce that they are using Unarmed Combat.

Each level of this superpower:

- Adds +2 points per level to damage for any successful Brawl or Grapple attack.
- Acts as 2 points per level of (additional) armor to limbs when parrying melee, missile, or unarmed attacks while unarmed. This armor value is only applied if the parry is successful, and damage is being applied. The 2 points per level are also subtracted from damage determining a knockback or other weapon breakage.
- Modify a single attacker’s chance to hit your character in a combat round by –5% per level. Pick who suffers this modifier, and it can vary from round to round. Alternatively, this penalty can be divided among multiple opponents in –5% increments, at the player’s discretion.
- Modifies unarmed hand-to-hand attacks by +5% per level when the Brawl or Grapple skill is used. This applies to all qualifying attacks made in a combat round.

If using Unarmed Combat and facing an opponent using the same power, make a resistance roll of the opposing power levels. If both succeed, or both fail, the superpowers cancel each other and no one benefits from the superpower for five combat rounds. If only one of the combatants is successful, they can use Unarmed Combat while their opponent(s) cannot. If the combat is still occurring at the end of the five rounds, make another resistance roll, as before. Unarmed Combat is always effective against anyone without the superpower.

Unarmed Combat works in conjunction with the Martial Arts skill, with all modifiers from that skill combining with the superpower’s benefits. The Brawl and Grapple skills are also relevant.

### Weather Control

**Base Range:** 15 meters per level

**Duration:** 1 combat round

Power Cost: 3 per level

**Power Point Cost:** 3 per level to activate, 1 per combat round to maintain

Weather Control allows control over weather in the immediate area, creation of new atmospheric conditions, manipulation of ambient temperature, increasing or decreasing precipitation, and manifesting any of a variety of non-harmful weather conditions such as fog, freezing rain, etc. Each level increases the range by an additional 15 meters. While the effects only affect those within the range of the power, the actual extent of the weather is more widespread, as appropriate.

Additionally, Weather Control confers the following abilities:

- Each level can raise or lower the temperature by ±5° Celsius. See **Cold and Freezing** and **Fire and Heat** for more information.
- Each level allows your character to alter conditions such as wind, clouds, and rain by one ‘step’ per combat round (see **Weather Conditions**).
- A hailstorm or thunderclap can potentially cause stunning effects (see **Stunning or Subduing**).
- High winds can potentially cause knockback effects.
- Tornadoes that can cause sweep attacks or reduce the attack chances for missile weapon use (see tornado-force winds in **Weather Conditions**).
- Rain that can douse a fire, including fires created with Energy Control.
- Snow and/or ice that can make a surface slippery and dangerous (see **Slippery or Unstable Surfaces**).
- Fog that can reduce effective visual range to five meters (see **Weather Conditions**).

Other effects can be devised with your gamemaster’s approval.

Once the superpower ends, the weather returns to its normal state by one step per combat round. Weather Control does not allow your character to throw lightning bolts or weather effects strong enough to cause direct damage. These are covered by Energy Projection.
